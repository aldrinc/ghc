# PRD: GHC Platform UI Refactor (Base UI + Tailwind)

## 0) Executive summary

### What’s changing

You’ll refactor the app from a “4 tabs + raw forms + raw workflow signals” interface into a **task-driven operations console**:

* A persistent **App Shell** (sidebar + header + routed pages)
* **Entity-first navigation** (Clients, Campaigns, Library, Workflows) plus a **Tasks/Approvals** view
* **Progressive disclosure** for complex actions (onboarding + approvals), so the UI is learnable but still powerful ([Nielsen Norman Group][1])
* Replace ad-hoc HTML controls with a consistent set of **Base UI primitives** (Dialog, Alert Dialog, Select, Field/Form, Menu, Tabs, Toast, Tooltip, Popover, ScrollArea, Progress) ([Base UI][2])

### Why this matters

Right now the UI exposes *implementation details* (signals, empty approved_ids arrays, internal step names) rather than the operator’s mental model (“what needs my attention, what is blocked, what do I do next?”). This is the core clarity problem.

---

## 1) Background & current-state audit

### Current UI (as shipped)

* Single page with local `tab` state; no URLs/deep linking.
* Each page mixes:

  * creation forms
  * lists
  * actions
  * status messaging
* Workflows are a “table + sendSignal buttons” surface with limited context.

### Key issues to address

1. **No information hierarchy**: everything is on the same plane (forms, lists, actions). Users must “read the whole page” to find next steps.
2. **Cognitive overload on onboarding**: the onboarding form is long, optional fields are mixed with required fields, and it’s not staged. NN/g recommends progressive disclosure to reduce cognitive load in forms ([Nielsen Norman Group][3]).
3. **Workflow actions aren’t self-explanatory**: “Approve canon/metrics/strategy…” are internal terms. The UI should explain consequences, show the artifact being approved, and show what’s blocked.
4. **Approvals UI is under-specified**: `approve-experiments` and `approve-assets` currently send `{ approved_ids: [] }`. If the backend expects actual IDs, the UI cannot function until you expose “pending items” via API.
5. **Error + validation UX is weak**: success/error text is shown as a generic message; field-level errors are minimal. NN/g recommends keeping errors next to fields and making them actionable ([Nielsen Norman Group][4]).
6. **Accessibility risk**: unstyled focus states and inconsistent semantics increase keyboard and screen-reader issues. WCAG requires visible focus ([W3C][5]).
7. **Developer ergonomics**: you have TanStack Query installed but not used; repeated `useEffect` fetching and manual cache invalidation.

---

## 2) Goals, non-goals, and success metrics

### Goals

1. **Make “what to do next” obvious**:

   * A top-level **Tasks/Approvals** view aggregating workflow runs requiring human action.
   * Per-workflow detail view shows “blocked step”, artifacts, and safe action buttons.

2. **Make onboarding & planning learnable**:

   * Convert onboarding into a multi-step wizard (progressive disclosure) ([Nielsen Norman Group][1]).
   * Use Base UI Form + Field for consistent labeling, required states, and error presentation ([Base UI][6]).

3. **Standardize UI primitives on Base UI**

   * Base UI is unstyled but built for accessible, composable primitives ([Base UI][7]).
   * Build a thin internal UI layer (`src/components/ui/*`) so the rest of the app doesn’t hand-style every dialog/menu/select.

4. **Improve navigation and deep linking**

   * Add routing (so `/workflows/:id` and `/clients/:id` can be shared, bookmarked, and restored).

5. **Upgrade feedback + confidence**

   * Toast notifications for transient success/error feedback, including keyboard landmark support and centralized providers ([Base UI][8]).

### Non-goals (explicitly out of scope for this refactor)

* Building the full “Artifact editor” UI for Canon/MetricSchema/StrategySheet JSON authoring.
* Implementing asset rendering pipelines or creative previews.
* Implementing role-based permissions (beyond basic auth) unless already in backend.

### Success metrics (measurable)

* **Time-to-first-success**: median time from “Create client” → “Onboarding started” decreases by 30%.
* **Approval throughput**: median time from “workflow waiting approval” → “approval completed” decreases by 40%.
* **Error rate**: % of onboarding submissions failing client-side validation reduces (should be near-zero if staged well).
* **Support burden**: number of “what does this button do?” questions drops (proxy: internal feedback).

---

## 3) Users & primary workflows

### Personas

* **Operator (Account/Producer)**: creates clients, triggers onboarding, monitors workflow runs.
* **Strategist**: reviews Canon/Strategy artifacts, approves or requests changes.
* **Analyst/Measurement**: reviews MetricSchema, validates measurement readiness.
* **Performance**: triggers planning workflows, monitors status.

### Primary user journeys

1. **Create client → start onboarding**
2. **Review onboarding workflow → approve Canon + MetricSchema**
3. **Create campaign → enter business goal → start planning**
4. **Review planning workflow → approve Strategy/Experiments/Assets**
5. **Browse library (Swipes) for references**
6. **Inspect workflow logs when something fails**

---

## 4) Information architecture & navigation

### Proposed IA (sidebar)

* **Home / Tasks** (default landing after sign-in)
* **Clients**
* **Campaigns**
* **Library** (rename “Swipes” to “Library” in UI; keep API name if needed)
* **Workflows**
* (Later) Settings

Rationale:

* Current IA is feature-first; you need a **task-first** landing surface because approvals are what block the machine. This follows complex application guidance: help users manage high-impact tasks and handoffs ([Nielsen Norman Group][9]).

### Navigation patterns

* **Desktop**: left sidebar, collapsible.
* **Mobile**: sidebar becomes an overlay drawer (Base UI Dialog can serve as the drawer mechanism since it’s a full-page popup primitive) ([Base UI][10]).
* **Header**: page title + contextual actions + user menu (Clerk `UserButton`).

> Critical assumption check: If your users are *only* internal and always power users, you might be tempted to keep the “Workflows tab + raw buttons” model. But your own spec emphasizes approvals and handoffs—those are exactly where UX clarity prevents expensive mistakes.

---

## 5) Design principles you should enforce

1. **Progressive disclosure by default**

   * Don’t show advanced/rare fields and actions until needed ([Nielsen Norman Group][1]).
   * Example: hide “raw signal path” behind an “Advanced” section in workflow details.

2. **Inline, actionable form errors**

   * Errors appear next to fields; avoid tooltip-based errors; avoid modal errors except for destructive confirmations ([Nielsen Norman Group][4]).
   * Use Base UI Field/Error and native constraint validation for consistency ([Base UI][2]).

3. **Strong status semantics**

   * Always show: **Status badge + last updated + blocked step + next action**.

4. **Accessible by construction**

   * Maintain visible focus indicators (WCAG 2.4.7) ([W3C][5]).
   * Use Base UI primitives for keyboard navigation and ARIA semantics where appropriate ([Base UI][7]).

---

## 6) Base UI adoption strategy

### Why Base UI fits your use-case

Base UI is explicitly positioned as unstyled, professional primitives for building accessible React interfaces ([Base UI][7]). That matches your app: internal tool, lots of custom flows, and you don’t want a heavy theme framework.

### Installation & required setup

* Add Base UI:

  * `npm i @base-ui/react` ([Base UI][11])
* Ensure portal stacking works:

  * Base UI uses portals for popups (Dialog/Popover/etc.). Add `isolation: isolate` to the app layout root ([Base UI][11]).

### Composition & wrapper components

Base UI is designed to be composed via `render` props, but your app should not repeat composition boilerplate everywhere. Create wrappers that forward refs correctly ([Base UI][12]).

**Deliverable**: `src/components/ui/` layer

* `Button` (Base UI Button)
* `Input` (Base UI Input + Field integration) ([Base UI][13])
* `Select` (Base UI Select) ([Base UI][14])
* `Dialog` / `Sheet` (Base UI Dialog) ([Base UI][10])
* `AlertDialog` (for destructive confirms) ([Base UI][15])
* `Menu` (row actions) ([Base UI][16])
* `Tabs` (in-page sections) ([Base UI][17])
* `Toast` (notifications) ([Base UI][8])
* `Tooltip` (icon affordances) ([Base UI][18])
* `Popover` (filters, quick actions) ([Base UI][19])
* `ScrollArea` (logs + long panels) ([Base UI][20])
* `Progress` (workflow progress indicator) ([Base UI][21])

### Styling approach

Base UI is unstyled; you’ll style via Tailwind. Use:

* `data-*` attributes and CSS variables exposed by components for state styling ([Base UI][22]).

---

## 7) New App Shell (layout PRD)

### Layout structure

* **Sidebar**

  * Logo + product name
  * Nav items + optional badge counts for pending approvals
  * Collapsible
  * `ScrollArea` for overflow nav on smaller heights ([Base UI][20])

* **Header**

  * Breadcrumbs or simple page title
  * Primary CTA (contextual): e.g., “New client”, “New campaign”
  * Search (phase 2)
  * UserButton (Clerk)

* **Main content**

  * Standard “PageHeader” component:

    * Title
    * Description (one line, optional)
    * Actions row (buttons/filters)

### Routing

Replace the tab state with routes:

* `/` → redirects to `/tasks`
* `/tasks`
* `/clients`
* `/clients/:clientId`
* `/campaigns`
* `/campaigns/:campaignId`
* `/library` (swipes)
* `/workflows`
* `/workflows/:workflowId`

---

## 8) Page-level PRD specs

### 8.1 Tasks / Approvals (new)

**Purpose**
Single place to see what’s blocked and what needs human input.

**Core UI**

* Filter chips: Status (Waiting Approval / Failed / Running), Kind, Client
* List view (table or cards):

  * Workflow kind
  * Client
  * Campaign
  * Blocked step
  * Started at
  * “Review” button → `/workflows/:id`

**Best-practice rationale**
Complex applications benefit when the interface supports sensemaking and risk mitigation; a dedicated task queue reduces “hunt-and-peck” behavior across pages ([Nielsen Norman Group][9]).

**API needs**

* If `/workflows` already returns all runs, you can derive “needs attention” from status.
* Optional: add server-side filtering parameters later.

---

### 8.2 Clients

#### Clients list

**Primary actions**

* “New client” (Dialog)
* Search + Industry filter (Popover)
* Row click → Client detail

**Table columns**

* Name
* Industry
* Onboarding status (Not started / In progress / Onboarded)
* Markets, Languages (summary)
* Actions (Menu): Start onboarding, View, Copy ID

Use `Menu` for row actions instead of inline button clusters ([Base UI][16]).

#### Create Client (Dialog)

* Fields: name (required), industry (optional)
* Inline validation with `Field` + `Form` ([Base UI][2])
* On success: toast “Client created” ([Base UI][8])

#### Client detail

Tabs (Base UI Tabs) ([Base UI][17]):

* Overview
* Onboarding
* Campaigns (read-only list)
* Workflows (filtered list)

---

### 8.3 Onboarding (replaces current giant form)

**Current problem**
You’re mixing required inputs with optional context and asking for everything in one screen, which increases abandonment/error risk ([Nielsen Norman Group][3]).

**Proposed UX: Onboarding wizard (Dialog or full page)**

* Step 1: Basics

  * Business type (new/existing) — existing shows disabled with explanation
  * Brand story/context (required)
* Step 2: Markets & Languages (required)
* Step 3: Offers/products (required)
* Step 4: Constraints (optional)
* Step 5: Competitors (optional)
* Step 6: Funnel + business model + goals (optional)
* Step 7: Review & submit

Use a progress indicator (Base UI Progress or a custom stepper UI) ([Base UI][21]).

**Form mechanics**

* Use Base UI `Form` + `Field` to keep labeling, required states, and errors consistent ([Base UI][6]).
* Error rules:

  * Don’t validate before input is complete (validate on blur/next-step).
  * Errors shown next to fields and written as explicit, constructive guidance ([Nielsen Norman Group][4]).

**Output behavior**

* On submit:

  * POST `/clients/:id/onboarding`
  * Show toast “Onboarding started”
  * Navigate to the workflow run detail (requires API to return workflow ID or a lookup endpoint)

**API enhancement recommended**
Return `{ workflow_run_id }` from onboarding start, so the UI can deep-link to the exact run.

---

### 8.4 Campaigns

#### Campaigns list

* “New campaign” (Dialog)
* Filter by client (Select) ([Base UI][14])
* Row click → Campaign detail

#### Campaign detail

Tabs:

* Overview
* Planning
* Workflows
* (Later) Experiments / Assets

#### Start planning (upgrade from current “business_goal_id only”)

Right now you send `{ business_goal_id: "goal-"+Date.now() }`—that’s a placeholder, and it will become tech debt fast.

**PRD requirement**
Add a “Business Goal” form that captures the structured object you already spec’d (objective type, numeric target, timeframe, budget, markets, constraints). Use:

* Base UI Select for objective type ([Base UI][14])
* Base UI Number Field for numeric fields where appropriate ([Base UI][23])
* Base UI Field/Form validation ([Base UI][2])

**Backend implication**
Either:

* Create a real `BusinessGoal` resource first and return its ID, or
* Let `/campaigns/:id/plan` accept the goal object directly.

---

### 8.5 Library (Swipes)

**Rename in UI**

* “Swipes” is insider language. Use “Library” and expose “Swipes” as a subsection later.

**List UI**

* Grid cards with title + platform badges
* Filters (Popover): platform, format, tags ([Base UI][19])
* Empty state: “No library assets loaded” + CTA to import (even if import is not built yet, define the CTA)

**Detail view (Dialog)**

* Show metadata, links, notes.
* This is where you can later add “Attach to AssetBrief” functionality.

---

### 8.6 Workflows (major redesign)

#### Workflows list

* Filters: status, kind, client, campaign
* Table rows:

  * Kind
  * Status (badge)
  * Client
  * Campaign
  * Started
  * Current step
  * Actions (Menu): Open, Stop, Copy ID

#### Workflow detail (new)

Split into:

* Header: Kind + Status + progress + primary CTA (“Approve next step” if blocked)
* Tabs:

  * Summary
  * Steps
  * Artifacts
  * Logs

Use `Tabs` ([Base UI][17]) and `ScrollArea` for logs ([Base UI][20]).

##### Steps tab (the heart)

Represent each step as a timeline/stepper:

* Canon
* Metrics
* Strategy
* Experiments
* Assets
* Launch/Run
* Measurement/Report
* Playbook update (later)

Each step shows:

* Status: complete / waiting approval / failed / skipped
* “View artifact” (if available)
* Action buttons (Approve / Request changes / Retry / Stop)

##### Approval actions (Base UI primitives)

* **Approve**: primary button
* **Stop**: destructive, must be confirmed via Base UI Alert Dialog ([Base UI][15])
* Use `Toast` for feedback after any signal ([Base UI][8])

##### Artifacts tab

This is where the current UX is most lacking: approving something you can’t see is a trust fail.

**PRD requirement**

* For each artifact (canon, metric schema, strategy…), show:

  * Read-only summary (rendered)
  * “View JSON” toggle (Collapsible)
  * “Download JSON” (later)

This relies on API endpoints like:

* `GET /workflows/:id/artifacts/canon`
* `GET /workflows/:id/artifacts/metric-schema`
* etc.

##### Logs tab

* Display logs as structured rows:

  * step
  * status
  * timestamp (if available)
  * error (expandable)

Use `ScrollArea` to keep logs usable without infinite page height ([Base UI][20]).

#### Critical backend/API gap: approved_ids

Your UI can’t approve experiments/assets meaningfully until it can fetch the candidate IDs.

**PRD requirement**
Expose:

* `GET /workflows/:id/pending-experiments`
* `GET /workflows/:id/pending-assets`

Then the UI can:

* Render a selectable list with checkboxes
* Default to “select all”
* Send `{ approved_ids: [...] }`

If you intentionally want “approve all”, rename the signal to avoid the misleading shape.

---

## 9) Global UI components & behavior

### Notifications

Adopt Base UI Toast with a single provider wrapping the app ([Base UI][8]):

* Success: created client, onboarding started, approval sent
* Error: network error, backend error message

Implement a global toast manager (so you can fire toasts from outside React Query callbacks if needed) ([Base UI][8]).

### Dialog & confirmation patterns

* Create/edit flows: `Dialog` ([Base UI][10])
* Destructive actions: `AlertDialog` ([Base UI][15])
* Don’t use modals for routine errors (inline errors are better) ([Nielsen Norman Group][4])

### Forms

* Use Base UI `Form` + `Field`:

  * Field label + description + control + error ([Base UI][6])
* Use native validation attributes where possible (required, minLength, etc.) ([Base UI][24])
* Ensure form controls have accessible names (Base UI Input guidelines) ([Base UI][13])

### Styling conventions

* Establish design tokens (even if implemented via Tailwind classes):

  * Surface, border, text, muted text, primary, danger
* Use Base UI data attributes + CSS variables for state styling (hover/focus/invalid, etc.) ([Base UI][22])

---

## 10) Technical refactor plan (front-end)

### 10.1 Project structure (recommended)

```
src/
  app/
    AppShell.tsx
    routes.tsx
  components/
    layout/
      Sidebar.tsx
      Header.tsx
      PageHeader.tsx
    ui/
      button.tsx
      input.tsx
      select.tsx
      dialog.tsx
      alert-dialog.tsx
      menu.tsx
      tabs.tsx
      toast.tsx
      tooltip.tsx
      popover.tsx
      scroll-area.tsx
      progress.tsx
  api/
    client.ts (fetch wrapper)
    endpoints/
      clients.ts
      campaigns.ts
      workflows.ts
      swipes.ts
  pages/
    TasksPage/
    ClientsPage/
    ClientDetailPage/
    CampaignsPage/
    CampaignDetailPage/
    LibraryPage/
    WorkflowsPage/
    WorkflowDetailPage/
```

### 10.2 Routing

* Replace tab state with a router.
* Keep Clerk gating:

  * SignedOut → render sign-in route/layout
  * SignedIn → AppShell routes

### 10.3 Data fetching

* Migrate all `useEffect` fetches to **TanStack Query**:

  * `useQuery` for lists and details
  * `useMutation` for creates and signals
  * Invalidate queries on success

### 10.4 API client

Keep your `useApiClient`, but:

* Move it to `src/api/client.ts`
* Add helpers:

  * `get<T>(path)`
  * `post<T>(path, body)`
* Normalize errors to `{ message, status, raw }` so UI can show consistent toasts.

### 10.5 Base UI setup requirements

* Add `#root { isolation: isolate; }` (or equivalent wrapper div) for portal stacking ([Base UI][11]).
* Create a `ToastProvider` at the top-level (AppShell) ([Base UI][8]).

### 10.6 Fix existing correctness issues

* `ClientsPage` bug: the list button calls `handleStartOnboarding(c.id)` but the function signature takes no args. Refactor onboarding start to accept a client ID OR remove that button in favor of “Start onboarding” on client detail.
* Ensure all buttons that live inside clickable rows use proper event handling (your `stopPropagation()` pattern is correct, but it should be standardized via row action menu).

---

## 11) Accessibility & UX requirements (acceptance-level)

### Accessibility

* Visible focus indicator on all interactive elements (WCAG 2.4.7) ([W3C][5])
* All inputs have labels (prefer Field) ([Base UI][13])
* Keyboard navigation:

  * Menus navigable via arrow keys (Base UI Menu supports keyboard navigation) ([Base UI][16])
  * Toast viewport keyboard landmark behavior (Base UI: F6 jump) ([Base UI][8])

### Form UX rules

* Errors shown inline next to fields; avoid tooltip errors ([Nielsen Norman Group][4])
* Don’t show errors before the user completes input (validate on blur or step transition) ([Nielsen Norman Group][4])
* Use progressive disclosure for long forms ([Nielsen Norman Group][3])

---

## 12) API/Backend requirements (to unblock the UI)

These are the minimum additions that make the redesigned UI actually useful.

1. **Return workflow_run_id from onboarding and planning**

   * `POST /clients/:id/onboarding` → `{ workflow_run_id }`
   * `POST /campaigns/:id/plan` → `{ workflow_run_id }`

2. **Expose artifacts for review**

   * `GET /workflows/:id/artifacts/:artifactType`
   * artifactType = `canon | metric-schema | strategy | experiments | assets` (as you implement)

3. **Expose pending approval items for selection**

   * `GET /workflows/:id/pending-experiments`
   * `GET /workflows/:id/pending-assets`

Without these, your UI will remain a “blind approve” surface—which is a trust and safety problem for workflows involving compliance-sensitive outputs.

---

## 13) Milestones & implementation phases

### Phase 1 — Foundation (App shell + Base UI primitives)

* Add router + AppShell (sidebar/header)
* Install Base UI and implement root isolation ([Base UI][11])
* Build `ui/` wrappers: Button, Input, Select, Dialog, AlertDialog, Menu, Tabs, Toast ([Base UI][10])
* Migrate success/error messages to Toast ([Base UI][8])

### Phase 2 — Clients + onboarding wizard

* Refactor Clients list + create dialog
* Add Client detail page
* Replace onboarding form with wizard (staged)
* Add validations and inline errors ([Nielsen Norman Group][4])

### Phase 3 — Workflows redesign

* Add workflow detail route
* Implement Steps/Artifacts/Logs tabs
* Replace button cluster with context menu + confirmations ([Base UI][16])
* Add filters and “Needs attention” indicators

### Phase 4 — Campaigns planning UX

* Add business goal form (structured)
* Start planning from Campaign detail
* Deep-link to workflow run

### Phase 5 — Library polish

* Rename Swipes → Library in UI
* Add filters/search and detail dialog

---

## 14) Acceptance criteria (what “done” means)

### Global

* App uses routed navigation; refreshing preserves the current view.
* All popups (dialogs/menus/popovers) render above content correctly (portal isolation applied) ([Base UI][11]).
* Toasts show for all mutations with success/failure states ([Base UI][8]).

### Clients

* Create client via dialog, validated, success toast.
* Start onboarding via staged wizard:

  * cannot submit without required fields
  * errors appear inline next to the relevant fields ([Nielsen Norman Group][4])

### Workflows

* Workflows list shows status badges and can filter by status/kind.
* Workflow detail:

  * shows steps and indicates which step is awaiting approval
  * actions are contextual (only show valid actions for the current step)
  * “Stop” requires confirmation via alert dialog ([Base UI][15])
  * logs are readable in a scrollable panel ([Base UI][20])

### Accessibility

* Keyboard focus indicator is always visible ([W3C][5])
* Inputs have labels (Field or aria-label) ([Base UI][13])

---

## 15) Risks & mitigations

1. **Risk: Base UI churn / API changes**

   * Base UI has active releases; mitigate by pinning a version and keeping wrappers thin. Keep your `ui/` wrappers as the only import boundary.

2. **Risk: Workflow approvals remain “blind”**

   * If backend doesn’t expose artifacts, the redesigned approval UX can’t be trusted. Mitigate by prioritizing artifact endpoints before polishing visuals.

3. **Risk: Overbuilding UI before backend maturity**

   * Don’t build complex selection UIs (approve specific experiments/assets) until you confirm the backend contract.

4. **Risk: Too much “dashboard polish” too early**

   * Your platform’s core value is orchestration + approvals, not charts. Keep phase 1–3 focused on clarity and correctness.

---

## 16) Concrete “next commit” checklist (first PR)

* [ ] Install `@base-ui/react` ([Base UI][11])
* [ ] Add `#root { isolation: isolate; }` ([Base UI][11])
* [ ] Add Toast provider at app root and replace all message banners with toasts ([Base UI][8])
* [ ] Create `AppShell` with sidebar + header
* [ ] Add router and convert tabs into routes
* [ ] Add `ui/Button`, `ui/Dialog`, `ui/AlertDialog`, `ui/Menu`, `ui/Select`, `ui/Tabs`, `ui/Field+Form` wrappers ([Base UI][10])
* [ ] Fix `ClientsPage` onboarding handler bug and move “Start onboarding” to client detail

---

If you want the next iteration to be maximally actionable for implementation, I can turn this PRD into:

* a **proposed component inventory** (exact wrapper APIs for `ui/*`)
* a **route map + page wireframes** (textual, but precise)
* and a **migration diff plan** (what files get replaced vs. introduced)
