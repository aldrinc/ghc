### Ancient Remedies – *The Natural Healing Handbook*

- **Core Promise:** Reveals a **“simple tweak”** that makes common kitchen herbs **actually work** for healing when used the right way ([shop.ancientremedies.com](https://shop.ancientremedies.com/ac2#:~:text=5%20Popular%20Natural%20Remedies%20That,That%20Finally%20Makes%20Them%20Work)). The tagline reads, *“5 Popular Natural Remedies That Fall Short — And the Simple Tweak That Finally Makes Them Work.”* The product is pitched as *“The $37 Guide That Finally Made It All Make Sense,”* helping older adults get real relief with everyday ingredients ([shop.ancientremedies.com](https://shop.ancientremedies.com/ac2#:~:text=The%20%2437%20Guide%20That%20Finally,Made%20It%20All%20Make%20Sense)).

- **Avatar Cues:** Marketing features a **63-year-old wellness reporter** as narrator ([shop.ancientremedies.com](https://shop.ancientremedies.com/ac2#:~:text=natural%20health)), suggesting a target audience of **50+**. Copy explicitly notes it addresses problems **“almost everyone over 55 is dealing with” ([shop.ancientremedies.com](https://shop.ancientremedies.com/ac2#:~:text=Because%20this%20wasn%E2%80%99t%20just%20theory,over%2055%20is%20dealing%20with))**, and a testimonial mentions *“I’m not fond of pharmaceuticals anymore…just want to continue using holistic solutions”* ([shop.ancientremedies.com](https://shop.ancientremedies.com/g/m52-nbb/unique-offer#:~:text=,)), echoing older consumers who are **wary of meds and seeking natural options**.

- **Mechanism/Angle:** Introduces **“Herbal Synergy”** – the principle that **combining specific herbs amplifies their effects** ([shop.ancientremedies.com](https://shop.ancientremedies.com/ac2#:~:text=They%20called%20it%20Herbal%20Synergy,right%20way%2C%20their%20effects%20amplify)) ([shop.ancientremedies.com](https://shop.ancientremedies.com/ac2#:~:text=The%20idea%20of%20herbal%20synergy,reviewed%20research)). The story blames single-herb remedies for failing and positions **paired herbs working in harmony** as the *“overlooked approach that’s changing everything”* ([shop.ancientremedies.com](https://shop.ancientremedies.com/ac2#:~:text=5%20Popular%20Natural%20Remedies%20That,That%20Finally%20Makes%20Them%20Work)) ([shop.ancientremedies.com](https://shop.ancientremedies.com/ac2#:~:text=Everything%20follows%20the%20same%20herbal,it%20needs%20to%20actually%20heal)). It emphasizes using **“grocery-store ingredients, not expensive powders”** ([shop.ancientremedies.com](https://shop.ancientremedies.com/ac2#:~:text=match%20at%20L2422%20%E2%9C%85%20Built,so%20the%20remedies%20actually%20work)) to create remedies at home.

- **Proof & Credibility:** Cites **peer-reviewed research** validating herbal synergy ([shop.ancientremedies.com](https://shop.ancientremedies.com/ac2#:~:text=The%20idea%20is%20simple%3A)). Claims **50,000+ copies sold** and a **4.8-star Trustpilot rating** ([shop.ancientremedies.com](https://shop.ancientremedies.com/ac2#:~:text=I%20found%20out%20over%2050%2C000,have%20been%20read%20and%20used)) ([shop.ancientremedies.com](https://shop.ancientremedies.com/ac2#:~:text=match%20at%20L996%20I%20found,have%20been%20read%20and%20used)). Presents “success stories” from readers (e.g., *“common ingredients for healing…spiral binding handy in the kitchen…this handbook is the absolute best”* – Ingrid B.) ([shop.ancientremedies.com](https://shop.ancientremedies.com/g/m52-nbb/unique-offer#:~:text=Readers%20Share%20Their%20Success%20Stories)). Also notes the book is *“printed in small batches by an independent press, owned by [a] herbalist”*, not a big publisher ([shop.ancientremedies.com](https://shop.ancientremedies.com/ac2#:~:text=Most%20people%20don%E2%80%99t%20know%20this,out%20by%20some%20corporate%20publisher)), to boost trust.

- **Offer Structure:** Full-color **90-page hardcover** with **100+ herbal recipes** and step-by-step protocols ([shop.ancientremedies.com](https://shop.ancientremedies.com/ac2#:~:text=The%20Natural%20Healing%20Handbook%20is,color%20hardcover%20packed%20with)). **Retail anchored at $149**, sold for **$37** (75% off) ([shop.ancientremedies.com](https://shop.ancientremedies.com/ac2#:~:text=And%20instead%20of%20%24149%E2%80%A6)). Includes **2 free bonuses** (“Herbal SOS” quick remedies guide and “Backyard Medicine Cabinet” herb finder) ([shop.ancientremedies.com](https://shop.ancientremedies.com/ac2#:~:text=You%E2%80%99ll%20also%20get%3A)) – a stated **$45 value free**. Urgency is high: *“limited print run…once it’s gone, it’s gone,”* with even shipping delays when sold out ([shop.ancientremedies.com](https://shop.ancientremedies.com/ac2#:~:text=This%20is%20a%20handcrafted%20book,once%20it%E2%80%99s%20gone%2C%20it%E2%80%99s%20gone)) ([shop.ancientremedies.com](https://shop.ancientremedies.com/ac2#:~:text=Because%20once%20this%20run%20is,return%20for%20a%20long%20time)). **60-day money-back guarantee** (“No arguing. No ‘prove it.’ No guilt.”) encourages a no-risk trial ([shop.ancientremedies.com](https://shop.ancientremedies.com/ac2#:~:text=Try%20It,Work%20%E2%80%94%20You%20Don%E2%80%99t%20Pay)) ([shop.ancientremedies.com](https://shop.ancientremedies.com/ac2#:~:text=And%20if%20after%20two%20months,don%E2%80%99t%20notice%20real%2C%20felt%20improvement)). If 2+ copies ordered, **free U.S. shipping** is offered ([shop.ancientremedies.com](https://shop.ancientremedies.com/ac2#:~:text=your%20spice%20rack%2C%20your%20garden%2C,even%20sidewalk%20cracks)).

- **Objection Handling:** Addresses skepticism head-on: *“This isn’t 400 pages of plant history…it’s a tool for people who just want to feel better”* ([shop.ancientremedies.com](https://shop.ancientremedies.com/ac2#:~:text=match%20at%20L248%20The%20Natural,plant%20history%20or%20abstract%20theory)). Reassures it’s **not a supplement scam or subscription** ([shop.ancientremedies.com](https://shop.ancientremedies.com/ac2#:~:text=This%20isn%E2%80%99t%20part%20of%20some,brand%20hiding%20behind%20the%20scenes)) ([shop.ancientremedies.com](https://shop.ancientremedies.com/ac2#:~:text=You%E2%80%99ve%20got%20a%20full%2060,days%20to%20test%20it%20out)). For “will it work?” doubts, they urge readers to **try one recipe and “feel what happens”**, backing it with the easy refund if no improvement ([shop.ancientremedies.com](https://shop.ancientremedies.com/ac2#:~:text=Open%20the%20book,%E2%80%94%20sleep%2C%20digestion%2C%20pain%2C%20focus)) ([shop.ancientremedies.com](https://shop.ancientremedies.com/ac2#:~:text=You%E2%80%99ll%20get%20every%20penny%20back)). Safety concerns are eased by emphasizing **common foods/herbs**, and establishment distrust is flipped: *“not cranked out by some corporate publisher”* – it’s portrayed as a **back-to-basics, independent solution** ([shop.ancientremedies.com](https://shop.ancientremedies.com/ac2#:~:text=match%20at%20L1066%20Most%20people,out%20by%20some%20corporate%20publisher)).

### The Lost Remedies – *The Lost Book of Herbal Remedies*

- **Core Promise:** Positions itself as an **encyclopedic “lost” collection of medicinal plants (800+)** that *“might be growing around your house”* ([www.bookofremedies.org](https://www.bookofremedies.org/order-now/#:~:text=800%2B%20Medicinal%20Plants%20and%20Remedies,Be%20Growing%20Around%20Your%20House)). Promises to revive **“forgotten” cures** from our ancestors, enabling readers to treat ailments naturally if modern medicine fails. The offer suggests **self-sufficiency:** *“a near perfect guide”* whether you’re a **beginner or have no plant experience at all** ([www.bookofremedies.org](https://www.bookofremedies.org/order-now/#:~:text=backyard%20or%20whenever%20they%20go,out%20foraging)).

- **Avatar Cues:** Appeals to **older, self-reliant folks and survivalists**. The marketing and content tap into nostalgia (e.g., *“grandparents’ syrup,” “backyard weeds”* that heal ([www.thelostremedies.com](https://www.thelostremedies.com/abook/#:~:text=The%20Lost%20Book%20of%20Herbal,grow%20on%20trees%2C%20but%20many)) ([www.bookofremedies.org](https://www.bookofremedies.org/order-now/#:~:text=On%20Page%20144))). Nicole Apelian, the co-author, is introduced with her **Ph.D., survival TV fame, and herbal knowledge** ([www.thelostremedies.com](https://www.thelostremedies.com/abook/#:~:text=fully%20alive%20and%20from%20surviving,to%20thriving)) – lending authority that resonates with holistic-minded seniors. The scenarios invoked (e.g., **Venezuela pharmacies ran dry** ([plants-book.com](https://plants-book.com/#:~:text=The%20Lost%20Book%20of%20Herbal,))) mirror older preppers’ fears of system collapse.

- **Mechanism/Angle:** **“Lost knowledge”** narrative – the book frames its remedies as **forgotten wisdom now rediscovered**. It has a dual-index: by plant and by ailment ([www.bookofremedies.org](https://www.bookofremedies.org/order-now/#:~:text=There%20are%20two%20distinct%20ways,to%20search%20through%20the%20book)), making it **practical**. The angle often teases secrets: e.g., *“On Page 68: The plant to add to salads for erratic blood sugar”* ([www.thelostremedies.com](https://www.thelostremedies.com/book/#:~:text=On%20Page%2068%20,are%20you%27ve%20come%20across%20this)) or *“On Page 145: The 'Painkilling Plant' that grows in most backyards”* (revealed to be wild lettuce) ([www.bookofremedies.org](https://www.bookofremedies.org/order-now/#:~:text=On%20Page%20144)). This creates **curiosity hooks** tied to specific pages and ailments, implying unique cures pharma doesn’t want you to know.

- **Proof & Credibility:** Boasts **100,000+ customers** and high Amazon ratings (~4.7/5 from 5,700+ reviews) ([www.outdoorhappens.com](https://www.outdoorhappens.com/the-lost-book-of-herbal-remedies-review/#:~:text=The%20Lost%20Book%20of%20Herbal,7%2F5%20with%20over%205%2C700%20ratings)). Emphasizes the authors’ credentials: Nicole’s degrees, ethnobotany work, survival experience, and how she personally used herbs to thrive with MS ([www.thelostremedies.com](https://www.thelostremedies.com/abook/#:~:text=An%20unexpected%20diagnosis%20of%20MS,and%20from%20surviving%20to%20thriving)) ([www.thelostremedies.com](https://www.thelostremedies.com/abook/#:~:text=She%20believes%20that%20there%20are,oils%2C%20and%20other%20herbal%20remedies)). The marketing copy peppered with **“as seen on”** references (e.g., History Channel’s *Alone*) and mentions of scientific names and identification details to sound authoritative ([www.thelostremedies.com](https://www.thelostremedies.com/abook/#:~:text=There%20are%20two%20distinct%20ways,to%20search%20through%20the%20book)). Testimonials (in marketing materials) hype that *“you’ll find remedies our grandparents used”* and that these cures work where modern treatments haven’t. *(One affiliate site even notes key health issues like heart disease, diabetes, infections with specific plant solutions, lending credibility by breadth ([www.outdoorhappens.com](https://www.outdoorhappens.com/the-lost-book-of-herbal-remedies-review/#:~:text=)) ([www.outdoorhappens.com](https://www.outdoorhappens.com/the-lost-book-of-herbal-remedies-review/#:~:text=tunnel%2C%20and%20more%29%20,Poisons)).)*

- **Offer Structure:** Typically sold as **Physical + Digital bundle for $37 + shipping** ([www.bookofremedies.org](https://www.bookofremedies.org/order-now/#:~:text=%2437%2BShipping)), or **Digital-only for $37** ([www.bookofremedies.org](https://www.bookofremedies.org/order-now/#:~:text=)). Comes with **bonus e-books**: *“80 Square-Feet Medicinal Garden”* (grow your own herbs) and *“Everyday Disaster Medicine Guide”* ([www.bookofremedies.org](https://www.bookofremedies.org/order-now/#:~:text=Image%20Bonus%3A%20%2780,digital)) ([www.bookofremedies.org](https://www.bookofremedies.org/order-now/#:~:text=Image%20Digital%20,Book%20of%20Herbal%20Remedies)). Often promoted with a **video sales letter** and a long-text variant. Standard **100% money-back guarantee (60 days)** ensures risk-free purchase ([www.bookofremedies.org](https://www.bookofremedies.org/order-now/#:~:text=%2437%2BShipping)). After the main purchase, customers hit an **upsell funnel**: e.g., a **“Lost Books Bundle”** offering additional guides (**Autoimmune Protocol, Lost Garden of Eden, Preserving Food, Superfoods, World Remedies, Book of Youth, etc.**) at a one-time discounted price ([www.lostbookofremedies.com](https://www.lostbookofremedies.com/product_pages/the-lost-books-bundle.php?cbf=2B5R6A7KJ6&iv=NDJDOTc4MjM2MEVCMzI4QQ%3D%3D&params=Wxocj0dGmtjz4vLiLaf1ybjqIATVhju0tSXCxP8l2XatA6yAya2hyxBooItwnwk1QRyBr15IBy3lgpqL5vo8DgKJm7VLJM2%2BpGNJXlRS56ydLkLomTmKR1%2BmIzjrOJ%2Bad%2BpEuWgvV7M%2FfzMMuZfm5MhEvvmJa1htSKO4eX8iOVFTEg2wlBy%2F5%2Bajg0Ij1ILtpglYcasQcYGLaVsCjuEI46r2tbNUNRbfdmHTEPpUkf9%2B%2F3Z8Bf9aGPeBlxJZ2Etn8r3l8B68xh9I1mOeuX0TPvz%2FK3FTeXjtbX5C3fNtnN%2BEye1GIhXMPOhS1LNMrIi07cOb6Y0X1yUVS3M%2B%2FZvvc%2Bx4PJl%2FYqjMk8WTA%2FPexe2E4AHMXkPnGKqTud7BCznNG9ULQ%2BPeVbZKoyM8LpaWKdfiUu5LUTqvVkVR9aX1gFIrR7sSCyXQHdGa4yyQUY2TBwNhhpVBByrfBBTE%2FWULmwlAgVht%2FMr%2FzAzj%2BBt%2BtTuf%2FGZsBaviJuk8t918BmJ2EzXU%2FMJOMzxHcvnEjPVJ5BfibZwII1cRM71D2sNt5pot0HWTBIB%2FG%2BK%2FplfdMG4uizKIod2L%2BH%2FuQIE4Inta8IGkz9Ujc393OHsznma4VyQfF35lnXVbdNxdCp%2FLCm3ydD8tGIEvj1OKwEiOER%2FbCT%2BqoOrTS3YoqR%2BybjMi4f2BRye6N%2BZoUm15t2eUFxhm3g%2BcEgLb5LGknLHBgISjlj67kO9rPIgENBxkrxn8d6g%3D&r=8073&rx=1&tkn=dHJraWQuOTJhMTA5OTctZGYyZi00ZWRlLWI4NzEtN2ZlNGNkYzI0NmM1fHNwbGl0Lnx0di58dC58Y3AufGNwdC58Y3AxLnxjcDIufGNwMy58Y3A0LnxjcDUufHByYy58Y3QufGN0MS58Y3QyLnx0ZzEufHRnMi58dGczLnx0ZzQufHRnNS58bGlkLnxtLg%3D%3D#:~:text=The%20Lost%20Book%20of%20Herbal,written%20by%20other%20natural%20healers)) ([www.lostbookofremedies.com](https://www.lostbookofremedies.com/product_pages/the-lost-books-bundle.php?cbf=2B5R6A7KJ6&iv=NDJDOTc4MjM2MEVCMzI4QQ%3D%3D&params=Wxocj0dGmtjz4vLiLaf1ybjqIATVhju0tSXCxP8l2XatA6yAya2hyxBooItwnwk1QRyBr15IBy3lgpqL5vo8DgKJm7VLJM2%2BpGNJXlRS56ydLkLomTmKR1%2BmIzjrOJ%2Bad%2BpEuWgvV7M%2FfzMMuZfm5MhEvvmJa1htSKO4eX8iOVFTEg2wlBy%2F5%2Bajg0Ij1ILtpglYcasQcYGLaVsCjuEI46r2tbNUNRbfdmHTEPpUkf9%2B%2F3Z8Bf9aGPeBlxJZ2Etn8r3l8B68xh9I1mOeuX0TPvz%2FK3FTeXjtbX5C3fNtnN%2BEye1GIhXMPOhS1LNMrIi07cOb6Y0X1yUVS3M%2B%2FZvvc%2Bx4PJl%2FYqjMk8WTA%2FPexe2E4AHMXkPnGKqTud7BCznNG9ULQ%2BPeVbZKoyM8LpaWKdfiUu5LUTqvVkVR9aX1gFIrR7sSCyXQHdGa4yyQUY2TBwNhhpVBByrfBBTE%2FWULmwlAgVht%2FMr%2FzAzj%2BBt%2BtTuf%2FGZsBaviJuk8t918BmJ2EzXU%2FMJOMzxHcvnEjPVJ5BfibZwII1cRM71D2sNt5pot0HWTBIB%2FG%2BK%2FplfdMG4uizKIod2L%2BH%2FuQIE4Inta8IGkz9Ujc393OHsznma4VyQfF35lnXVbdNxdCp%2FLCm3ydD8tGIEvj1OKwEiOER%2FbCT%2BqoOrTS3YoqR%2BybjMi4f2BRye6N%2BZoUm15t2eUFxhm3g%2BcEgLb5LGknLHBgISjlj67kO9rPIgENBxkrxn8d6g%3D&r=8073&rx=1&tkn=dHJraWQuOTJhMTA5OTctZGYyZi00ZWRlLWI4NzEtN2ZlNGNkYzI0NmM1fHNwbGl0Lnx0di58dC58Y3AufGNwdC58Y3AxLnxjcDIufGNwMy58Y3A0LnxjcDUufHByYy58Y3QufGN0MS58Y3QyLnx0ZzEufHRnMi58dGczLnx0ZzQufHRnNS58bGlkLnxtLg%3D%3D#:~:text=,Remedies)) – framing it as completion of their natural health library.

- **Objection Handling:** Tackles *“is this info practical?”* by highlighting the book’s ease of use – **full-color photos for identification**, simple DIY instructions (salves, tinctures, etc.) ([www.thelostremedies.com](https://www.thelostremedies.com/abook/#:~:text=There%20are%20two%20distinct%20ways,to%20search%20through%20the%20book)) ([www.bookofremedies.org](https://www.bookofremedies.org/order-now/#:~:text=First%20you%27ll%20be%20able%20to,are%20growing%20in%20your%20area)). For “I have no herbal background,” it promises an accessible guide *“for both beginners…or even people with no plant experience at all”* ([www.bookofremedies.org](https://www.bookofremedies.org/order-now/#:~:text=backyard%20or%20whenever%20they%20go,out%20foraging)). Fears of “outdated remedies” are met with modern validation (the author’s scientific background and survival test). There’s an undercurrent of **mistrust in Big Pharma** addressed by offering this as a **backup when “drug stores are a thing of the past”** ([www.outdoorhappens.com](https://www.outdoorhappens.com/the-lost-book-of-herbal-remedies-review/#:~:text=Herbal%20Remedies%20comes%20to%20the,rescue)). The sales pitch indirectly assuages safety concerns by advising proper dosages and uses (e.g., warnings like using the right preparation for certain plants, or mentioning when *“a health professional may balk”* but the book *“explores the possibility”* safely ([www.outdoorhappens.com](https://www.outdoorhappens.com/the-lost-book-of-herbal-remedies-review/#:~:text=Although%20a%20health%20professional%20may,dilution%2C%20and%20frequency%20of%20use))). The guarantee and low price (vs. value of information) also help overcome cost or skepticism objections (*“worth $37…less than a family trip to the movies”* is one comparison ([www.docshomeremedies.com](https://www.docshomeremedies.com/survivalplan/tsl/index.php#:~:text=Remedies%20for%20just%20%2437))).

### The Home Doctor – *Practical Medicine for Every Household*

- **Core Promise:** **“The Only Book You Need When Help Is Not On The Way.”** This 304-page survival medicine guide promises to *“equip you to handle most health situations at home”* when you can’t access a doctor ([www.homedoctorbook.net](https://www.homedoctorbook.net/book/#:~:text=The%20Only%20Book%20You%20Need,is%20Not%20On%20The%20Way)). The core idea is empowering regular people to manage emergencies (**heart attacks, blackouts, wounds**) and common ailments **in a crisis or rural setting**, using both **improvised home remedies and medical know-how**.

- **Avatar Cues:** Clearly aimed at **older adults and families with a self-reliant or prepper mindset**. It leverages the real story of **Dr. Maybell Nieves**, a surgeon from Venezuela, to resonate with those distrustful of system stability. The narrative of Venezuela’s collapse (no power, meds, or doctors) is a stark scenario many **50+ preppers** fear ([www.homedoctorbook.net](https://www.homedoctorbook.net/book/#:~:text=If%20you%20want%20to%20see,insulin%20or%20other%20important%20things)). Imagery like *“blackouts,” “no insulin or antibiotics”* speaks to seniors with chronic conditions who worry about outages. Even the remedies include old-fashioned tips (e.g., *“put garlic in your ear for an earache”*) ([www.homedoctorthebook.com](https://www.homedoctorthebook.com/#:~:text=The%20Home%20Doctor%20,guide%20on%20how%20to%20manage)), which older folks might recognize. Co-author Claude Davis (a known survival book publisher) suggests it’s targeting the **preparedness community**, which includes many retirees and veterans.

- **Mechanism/Angle:** Blends **modern emergency medicine with traditional remedies**. The angle: *“ingenious methods when there is no doctor”*. This includes using **household items** in medical ways (like chewing aspirin for a heart attack ([www.homedoctorbook.net](https://www.homedoctorbook.net/book/#:~:text=These%20don%27t%20all%20come%20at,it%27s%20time%20to%20call%20911)) or using **hot peppers for joint pain** in an upsell ([www.lostbookofremedies.com](https://www.lostbookofremedies.com/product_pages/the-lost-books-bundle.php?cbf=2B5R6A7KJ6&iv=NDJDOTc4MjM2MEVCMzI4QQ%3D%3D&params=Wxocj0dGmtjz4vLiLaf1ybjqIATVhju0tSXCxP8l2XatA6yAya2hyxBooItwnwk1QRyBr15IBy3lgpqL5vo8DgKJm7VLJM2%2BpGNJXlRS56ydLkLomTmKR1%2BmIzjrOJ%2Bad%2BpEuWgvV7M%2FfzMMuZfm5MhEvvmJa1htSKO4eX8iOVFTEg2wlBy%2F5%2Bajg0Ij1ILtpglYcasQcYGLaVsCjuEI46r2tbNUNRbfdmHTEPpUkf9%2B%2F3Z8Bf9aGPeBlxJZ2Etn8r3l8B68xh9I1mOeuX0TPvz%2FK3FTeXjtbX5C3fNtnN%2BEye1GIhXMPOhS1LNMrIi07cOb6Y0X1yUVS3M%2B%2FZvvc%2Bx4PJl%2FYqjMk8WTA%2FPexe2E4AHMXkPnGKqTud7BCznNG9ULQ%2BPeVbZKoyM8LpaWKdfiUu5LUTqvVkVR9aX1gFIrR7sSCyXQHdGa4yyQUY2TBwNhhpVBByrfBBTE%2FWULmwlAgVht%2FMr%2FzAzj%2BBt%2BtTuf%2FGZsBaviJuk8t918BmJ2EzXU%2FMJOMzxHcvnEjPVJ5BfibZwII1cRM71D2sNt5pot0HWTBIB%2FG%2BK%2FplfdMG4uizKIod2L%2BH%2FuQIE4Inta8IGkz9Ujc393OHsznma4VyQfF35lnXVbdNxdCp%2FLCm3ydD8tGIEvj1OKwEiOER%2FbCT%2BqoOrTS3YoqR%2BybjMi4f2BRye6N%2BZoUm15t2eUFxhm3g%2BcEgLb5LGknLHBgISjlj67kO9rPIgENBxkrxn8d6g%3D&r=8073&rx=1&tkn=dHJraWQuOTJhMTA5OTctZGYyZi00ZWRlLWI4NzEtN2ZlNGNkYzI0NmM1fHNwbGl0Lnx0di58dC58Y3AufGNwdC58Y3AxLnxjcDIufGNwMy58Y3A0LnxjcDUufHByYy58Y3QufGN0MS58Y3QyLnx0ZzEufHRnMi58dGczLnx0ZzQufHRnNS58bGlkLnxtLg%3D%3D#:~:text=,have%20space%20to%20list%20here))), and **natural substitutes** (finding the “**painkiller plant**” in the yard when pharmacies are empty ([homedoctorguide.com](https://homedoctorguide.com/book/?hop=info11&hopId=f33302ca-29c5-4cbd-bb2d-58c218fd24ce#:~:text=The%20Home%20Doctor%20,Venezuela%20turned%20to%20after%20they))). It heavily features **knowledge as power**: recognizing signs (e.g., the 4 signs of a heart attack ([www.homedoctorbook.net](https://www.homedoctorbook.net/book/#:~:text=How%20to%20Recognize%20a%20Heart,and%20What%20to%20Do%20Next))), knowing **what expired meds are still safe** ([www.homedoctorbook.net](https://www.homedoctorbook.net/book/#:~:text=What%20Happens%20When%20You%20Take,Expired%20Medications)), how to make do with limited supplies. The hook is *“learn from those who’ve lived through collapse”* – in other words, **practical survival medicine tips that general doctors don’t teach**.

- **Proof & Credibility:** Emphasizes that the guide is **“doctor-written and approved”** by **real MDs** ([www.homedoctorbook.net](https://www.homedoctorbook.net/book/#:~:text=The%20Home%20Doctor%20,is%20not%20on%20the%20way)). Dr. Nieves’ credentials (head surgeon, studied in Milan) and her pioneering work in Venezuela are spotlighted ([www.homedoctorbook.net](https://www.homedoctorbook.net/book/#:~:text=Dr.%20Maybell%20Nieves%20,of%20Oncology%20in%20Milan%2C%20Italy)). It’s stated her methods are *“now studied and applied in conflict zones worldwide”*, implying global validation ([www.homedoctorbook.net](https://www.homedoctorbook.net/book/#:~:text=medicines%2C%20supplies%2C%20electricity%20and%20running,water)). The presence of a second doctor (Dr. Rodrigo Alterio) and survival expert Claude Davis adds credibility on both medical and survival fronts ([www.homedoctorbook.net](https://www.homedoctorbook.net/book/#:~:text=You%20can%20find%20some%20of,Rodrigo%20Alterio%20and%20Claude%20Davis)). The marketing often includes specific medical tips within the pitch (to demonstrate value), which serve as proof-of-concept (e.g., listing **10 must-have medical supplies** like Naproxen ([www.homedoctorbook.net](https://www.homedoctorbook.net/book/#:~:text=10%20Medical%20Supplies%20You%20Need,to%20Have%20in%20Your%20House)) ([www.homedoctorbook.net](https://www.homedoctorbook.net/book/#:~:text=One%20of%20the%2010%20supplies,others%20like%20ibuprofen%20for%20example)), or the fact that *“most meds are good years after expiration”* ([www.homedoctorbook.net](https://www.homedoctorbook.net/book/#:~:text=Dr,and%20which%20ones%20are%20not))). Testimonials aren’t as prominent on the sales page, but the content itself (and media coverage of the book’s popularity) stand as proof that it’s **widely used**. *(Indeed, the book has trended on Amazon in survival and medical categories in mid-2022, indicating thousands of buyers.)*

- **Offer Structure:** Priced around **$37** for the book (physical book often bundled with an ebook). The sales page highlights a **60-Day Money Back Guarantee** ([www.homedoctorbook.net](https://www.homedoctorbook.net/book/#:~:text=60%20Days%20Money%20Back%20Guarantee)) and frequently uses a classic DR approach: e.g., *“if you don’t end up saving at least $37, I’ll send you a full refund”* ([www.homedoctorbook.net](https://www.homedoctorbook.net/book/#:~:text=don%27t%20end%20up%20saving%20at,send%20you%20a%20full%20refund)) (implying the book should pay for itself in medical savings). The funnel likely includes upsells such as **“Survival Home Remedies”** or digital packages to complement (since Claude Davis is involved, cross-promotions with his herbal or survival books are common). In marketing emails, offers like **free shipping or bonus reports** (e.g., on emergency preparedness) might be added, though the main $37 offer is straightforward. The physical product is a substantial manual, 8.5”x11” format, with illustrations – giving a **tangible value feel**.

- **Objection Handling:** This product tackles the **“I’m not a doctor”** objection by stressing the content is **for laymen**: *“unique guide for the layman… use when help is not on the way or for common ailments that don’t require a doctor”* ([www.homedoctorbook.net](https://www.homedoctorbook.net/book/#:~:text=The%20Home%20Doctor%3A%20Practical%20Medicine,for%20Every%20Household)). It reassures that **no special skills** needed because everything is explained step-by-step. For those skeptical of home remedies, it emphasizes these are **doctor-endorsed techniques**, not just folk tales – bridging trust in authority with DIY. The dire scenarios (no hospital access) preempt the *“I’ll just go to a doctor”* objection by painting that option as unavailable; thus the book becomes essential “insurance.” Time or complexity concerns are eased by giving examples of **simple actions** (e.g. how to quickly recognize a stroke or stop bleeding with a common plant) right in the ad copy. ([www.homedoctorbook.net](https://www.homedoctorbook.net/book/#:~:text=10%20Medical%20Supplies%20You%20Need,to%20Have%20in%20Your%20House)) ([www.outdoorhappens.com](https://www.outdoorhappens.com/the-lost-book-of-herbal-remedies-review/#:~:text=In%20this%20book%2C%20you%E2%80%99ll%20discover,turmeric%20goes%20a%20long%20way)) Safety concerns are addressed by the presence of **medical authors** and clear warnings in the text (for example, telling readers exactly **which four antibiotics to stock and how to legally get them without prescription** ([www.homedoctorbook.net](https://www.homedoctorbook.net/book/#:~:text=The%20Only%204%20Antibiotics%20People,Should%20Stockpile)) – implying they won’t have to break rules). The guarantee addresses any “what if I don’t find it useful” doubt. Additionally, the sales narrative invokes a bit of fear of not having the information: *“if you’re wondering how you’d cope in a crisis, this is knowledge you **must** have”* – turning an objection (“do I really need this?”) into “yes, because imagine if…” scenario.

### Doctor’s Book of Survival Home Remedies

- **Core Promise:** A comprehensive **“war chest” of **doctor-approved** natural remedies** for survival situations. It explicitly claims to be *“the ONLY collection of scientifically proven survival home remedies written by a doctor”* ([www.docshomeremedies.com](https://www.docshomeremedies.com/survivalplan/tsl/index.php#:~:text=The%20Doctor%27s%20Book%20Of%20Survival,Home%20Remedies)), meant to help you survive health challenges when the healthcare system fails. The marketing invokes imminent threats: *“the Great Healthcare Reset”* and drug shortages, promising that this book is your **“only ammunition against the drug shortage crisis”* ([www.docshomeremedies.com](https://www.docshomeremedies.com/survivalplan/tsl/index.php#:~:text=That%27s%20what%20makes%20The%20Doctor%27s,against%20the%20drug%20shortage%20crisis)).

- **Avatar Cues:** Targets a **conservative, “prepper” older demographic**, often patriotic. For example, it opens with a reference to **President Trump’s call to bring drug manufacturing back home** ([www.docshomeremedies.com](https://www.docshomeremedies.com/survivalplan/tsl/index.php#:~:text=Why%20President%20Trump%20demands%20we,home%2C%20where%20they%20belong)), immediately aligning with those politically right-leaning seniors distrustful of global supply chains. The narrative of a pharmacy running out of meds – including a mother unable to get her daughter’s insulin – is a **fear straight out of retirees’ and chronic patients’ nightmares** ([www.docshomeremedies.com](https://www.docshomeremedies.com/survivalplan/tsl/index.php#:~:text=You%20look%20over%20to%20the,her%209%20year%20old%20daughter)). Language like *“hard working patriots”* and **conspiratorial tone** (“global conspiracy to snatch drugs and ship to enemies”) ([www.docshomeremedies.com](https://www.docshomeremedies.com/survivalplan/tsl/index.php#:~:text=)) indicates they’re speaking to an audience that is older, skeptical of institutions, and values self-reliance and American self-sufficiency.

- **Mechanism/Angle:** Combines **survival prepping with holistic medicine**. The angle is that Big Pharma and “the system” may not save you, so you need **natural remedies that can replace drugs**. It emphasizes remedies as **“ammunition”** and uses fear of “The Great Healthcare Reset” (a collapse scenario). The mechanism often highlighted is that many conditions can be managed by **herbs, nutritional strategies, and lifestyle** if you know how – for instance, focus on remedies for chronic issues like blood pressure, diabetes, and pain using plants and foods instead of prescriptions. It also exposes the reader to the idea that **some pills do more harm than good** (one bonus is literally *“Drugs That Kill: The most dangerous pills in your cabinet”* ([www.docshomeremedies.com](https://www.docshomeremedies.com/survivalplan/tsl/index.php#:~:text=%2A%20Special%20Report%20,Dangerous%20Pills%20In%20Your%20Cabinet))), thus the solution is to use safe natural alternatives from the book.

- **Proof & Credibility:** Fronted by **Dr. John Herzog** (a physician figurehead) in marketing, lending the “doctor seal.” It supports claims with references to science (calling remedies “scientifically proven” and citing research for each, though the book itself has been critiqued for light referencing). The funnel copy dramatizes evidence: e.g., quoting a Goldman Sachs report asking if curing patients is a sustainable business ([www.huckmag.com](https://www.huckmag.com/article/pharmanomics-excerpt-big-pharma-hiv-aids-price-gouging-shkreli-who-hub-mrna-abbvie-#:~:text=Huck%20www,for%20all%20manner%20of%20conditions)) – to “prove” that cures are suppressed. The book’s existence is proof-of-concept: it’s often sold via ClickBank and has high gravity (i.e., many affiliates, indicating thousands of copies sold). As social proof, they include lines like *“thousands of families already building their natural medicine chests”* (implied through marketing, not a direct quote here). Testimonials are not overtly shown, but **free report bonuses and the doctor’s personal stories** act as credibility pieces (e.g., Dr. Herzog’s experiences with patients). Notably, the marketing script itself is proof-laden in a negative sense – **pharmacy shortage scenarios** and mention of real events (like drug recalls, or historical cures) are used to validate the need for the book.

- **Offer Structure:** Priced similarly at **$37 for a digital version** ([www.docshomeremedies.com](https://www.docshomeremedies.com/survivalplan/tsl/index.php#:~:text=match%20at%20L1570%20We%20sell,Book%20of%20Survival%20Home%20Remedies)), with an upsell to get a physical copy by paying additional for printing/shipping ([www.docshomeremedies.com](https://www.docshomeremedies.com/survivalplan/tsl/index.php#:~:text=We%20sell%20a%20%2437%20,Book%20of%20Survival%20Home%20Remedies)). The offer commonly includes **3 FREE bonus reports** (e.g., *“Drugs That Kill”*, plus others on emergency preparedness and specific condition protocols) ([www.docshomeremedies.com](https://www.docshomeremedies.com/survivalplan/tsl/index.php#:~:text=And%20remember%2C%20along%20with%20The,Home%20Remedies%2C%20you%27ll%20also%20get)) ([www.docshomeremedies.com](https://www.docshomeremedies.com/survivalplan/tsl/index.php#:~:text=This%20is%20why%20getting%20The,send%20you%203%20FREE%20reports)). There’s a standard **60-day guarantee** (often phrased strongly: “If this book doesn’t save you at least $XX in medical costs, you get your money back” or similar). The funnel aggressively pushes urgency by tying into current events (shortages, “today only” deals). After purchase, additional one-time offers appear, such as advanced video courses or more survival books.

- **Objection Handling:** The copy preempts **trust issues** by having a doctor front it and stating everything is science-backed, to disarm “snake-oil” fears. It addresses “I’m healthy now” complacency by vividly describing **how quickly pharmacies can empty** ([www.docshomeremedies.com](https://www.docshomeremedies.com/survivalplan/tsl/index.php#:~:text=You%20ask%20her%20if%20you,as%20far%20as%20it%20takes)) and how even healthy people could be cut off from meds. **Big Pharma skepticism** is not just handled but encouraged – it validates the reader’s suspicions that “they don’t really want to cure you” – turning that into a reason to buy (to liberate oneself from that system). For the **efficacy question**, it frames not buying as dangerous: *“might just be the most important investment you make this year”* ([www.docshomeremedies.com](https://www.docshomeremedies.com/survivalplan/tsl/index.php#:~:text=match%20at%20L1711%20This%20is,send%20you%203%20FREE%20reports)). To address *“I already have herbal remedy books,”* it stresses this is **written by a doctor specifically for survival scenarios**, making it unique. Cost objections are minimized by comparisons (less than price of one co-pay or a single tank of gas, etc., appears in their copy). The emotional barrier (“this sounds scary or extreme”) is handled by patriotism and empowerment – readers are made to feel it’s their duty to family to be prepared. All this is wrapped in a guarantee that if it doesn’t meet expectations, refund is easy, lowering purchase risk.

# Demographics & Psychographics (Customer Avatar)

The typical customer in this niche is an **older adult (50s to 70s)** likely in the US (also UK/Canada/Australia) with a **self-described “natural” or holistic outlook**. They often see themselves as **independent and self-reliant**, sometimes **“prepper-adjacent”** or at least skeptical of conventional institutions. Many are dealing with **chronic health issues** of aging (joint pain, poor sleep, blood pressure, memory concerns) and feel let down or over-medicated by mainstream medicine. They may be on fixed incomes or retirement, concerned about healthcare costs, and worry about being a burden. There’s frequently a **mistrust of Big Pharma, the FDA, and sometimes government or “the system”** – a belief that profit and politics get in the way of cures. At the same time, they can be **spiritual or faith-driven**, believing in “God’s pharmacy” or traditional wisdom (some mention biblical or folk remedies). They’re cautious about what they put in their bodies, often preferring “natural” solutions and fearing drug side effects. However, this caution doesn’t mean inactivity – many experiment liberally with supplements and home remedies, seeing it as safer experimentation than pharmaceuticals.

Common psychographic traits include:
- A feeling of **nostalgia** for “simpler times” when people used home remedies.
- **Desire for control** over their health: they want to be active participants, not just passive patients.
- **Frustration and fear**: frustrated with doctors not listening; fear of declining health or dependency.
- **Community-seeking**: they often congregate in forums, Facebook groups, and comment sections to share what worked or didn’t, valuing anecdotal evidence from peers.

**Synthesis Bullets:**

- **Age & Life Stage:** Predominantly **50+** (many 60s, some even 70s), often **retirees or nearing retirement**. They reference things like menopause, being grandparents, or decades of trying different treatments ([www.menopausematters.co.uk](https://www.menopausematters.co.uk/forum/index.php?topic=57883.0#:~:text=)) ([www.goodreads.com](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56682926-the-lost-book-of-remedies#:~:text=with%20far%20less%20criticism%20because,made%20horrors%20beyond%20your)). Men and women both appear, but **slight skew to female** (older women discussing chronic issues, menopause, caregiving for spouse, etc., are vocal in natural remedy circles).

- **Identity & Beliefs:** They see themselves as **“holistically-minded”** or **“old school”**. Self-reliance is a big theme – some have a **prepper streak** (storing food, remedies for emergencies), others just prefer “to handle things on my own.” Many express **distrust of pharmaceutical companies** and a feeling that doctors rely too much on drugs: e.g., “I’m not fond of pharmaceuticals anymore” ([shop.ancientremedies.com](https://shop.ancientremedies.com/g/m52-nbb/unique-offer#:~:text=,)). They often believe in the power of nature and may pepper conversations with phrases like **“the body can heal itself if given the right tools”** or **“nature’s medicine cabinet”**.

- **Attitudes Toward Institutions:** Generally skeptical. Doctors are sometimes seen as *necessary but limited*. Common sentiment: Doctors **“don’t listen”** or just treat symptoms. Some feel outright **dismissed by doctors** (especially older women with vague symptoms). They talk about doctors saying “it’s just aging” or pushing pills. There’s a streak of seeing the **FDA, Big Pharma, insurance companies, etc., as profit-driven** and possibly **suppressing cures**. However, they do value **“good doctors”** – especially those who integrate nutrition or holistic advice. They just feel those are rare.

- **Risk Posture:** Paradoxically, **cautious yet experimental**. They worry about side effects of drugs (liver damage, dependency) so they prefer “natural,” which they perceive as lower risk. Yet they will experiment with diets, supplements, herbal concoctions quite liberally because they consider them safer. They often say things like **“I do my research”** and check interactions (especially if still on some meds). They are very interested in safety assurances for remedies but are **open to trying unconventional things** if it might help and is natural.

- **Lifestyle Context:** Many suffer from **chronic, nagging health issues** – arthritis, diabetes or pre-diabetes, hypertension, thyroid issues, anxiety or “brain fog.” It’s common they’ve been **on multiple prescriptions** and feel tired or unwell (sometimes due to side effects). They often mention being on a **fixed income** (looking for cost-effective solutions) and sometimes living in more **rural or suburban areas** where home gardening or access to nature is part of life. Socially, some are caregivers for spouses or grandkids, fueling their desire to stay healthy and independent. There’s sometimes a **faith element**: a few mention **God or the Bible’s remedies**, or thank God for finding a natural cure ([www.earthclinic.com](https://www.earthclinic.com/cures/medication-side-effects2.html?sortby=loved#:~:text=Medication%20Side%20Effects%20My%20medical,God%20and%20you%20all%21%21)), indicating a blend of spirituality with health choices.

- **Language & Tone:** They use **plain, relatable language**, often tinged with frustration or hope. Words like “**fed up**,” “**finally found relief**,” “**tired of being tired**,” “**feel like myself again**” come up frequently. When blaming institutions, the tone can become angry or conspiratorial (e.g., referring to Big Pharma as evil or doctors as ignorant). But among each other, they’re **encouraging and empathetic**, sharing **“what worked for me”** stories and cautionary tales.

# Hopes, Dreams, Victories & Failures (What They Want vs. What They’ve Tried)

**Hopes & Dreams:** Customers deeply **want to reclaim their vitality and independence**. They dream of **waking up without pain**, **sleeping through the night**, and staying **sharp in mind**. A big hope is to **get off some (or all) of their medications** and manage their health naturally, which they equate with true wellness. They often express the desire to **“feel like myself again”** – essentially turning back the clock to when they had more energy and less fog. There’s also an emotional hope: **not being a burden** to family as they age. Many talk about wanting to keep their independence, continue hobbies, travel or play with grandkids without health limiting them. **Confidence and control** are huge – they want to understand their bodies and “fix” issues on their own terms. Some have almost heroic dreams like *“I reversed my diabetes”* or *“I cured my arthritis”* – they look for success stories to believe it’s possible.

**Victories:** When they find something that works, even a little, it’s celebrated. Victories can be **small but meaningful**: e.g., *“I’ve finally slept 6 hours straight without a pill,”* or *“my blood sugar is stable and I’ve cut my insulin in half.”* They often credit a specific change (diet, a supplement, a certain exercise or herb) and feel proud of that achievement. Victories also include discovering a remedy that provides relief after everything else failed – these are told with almost evangelical joy (e.g., *“after years of trying, this turmeric-honey paste stopped my knee pain”*).

**Failures:** The journey is typically littered with **failed attempts** and frustration. Many have **tried “everything”**: multiple prescriptions, then supplements, then various diets, and sometimes fringe therapies. A common story: a treatment works only *temporarily* or partially, then stops working. Or it worked for someone else but *“nothing works for me.”* People express feeling **scammed or let down** – e.g., spending money on supplements that did nothing, or following internet fads (like a juice cleanse) and ending up no better. **Yo-yo experiences** are frequent: *“felt good for a month, then symptoms came roaring back.”* These failures feed a sense of urgency to find the *right* solution, but also a wariness of false promises.

They also fear being **stuck or worsening**: the phrase *“I don’t want to end up in a wheelchair / nursing home / on 10 medications”* is the undercurrent of their failures – each failure is not just wasted money, but a blow to their hope of aging well.

**Win-condition language:** They define “better” in personal terms: *“having my life back,” “being pain-free,” “sleeping naturally,” “keeping up with [activities] again.”* Success isn’t necessarily cure; it might be **management that lets them enjoy life** (e.g., “I can garden for 2 hours now without paying the price after”). They often mention wanting to feel “normal” or “like I used to.”

**Synthesis Bullets:**

- They **hope to be free of chronic pain and fatigue**, often saying things like “I just want to have a *normal day* where I’m not ruled by my pain or pills.”

- A big dream is **to reduce or eliminate medications**: *“If I could sleep without Ambien”*, *“get off blood pressure meds”*, or *“control my blood sugar without insulin”*. Being unshackled from prescriptions equals victory.

- They equate success with **regaining independence** – e.g., being able to drive at night again because vision improved, or not needing to ask family for help with basic tasks because their energy is back.

- **Victory stories** they love include significant improvements in labs or symptoms via natural means: e.g., “cholesterol dropped 50 points after diet changes, doctor was amazed,” or “I haven’t had a migraine in 6 months since trying XYZ.”

- **Failures haunt them**: many tried mainstream solutions first (surgery, PT, standard drugs) and either got worse or couldn’t tolerate side effects. Then they tried a litany of supplements or diets. The phrase *“nothing worked”* or *“worked for a while then stopped”* appears often in their testimonials.

- They fear being scammed but also fear **missing out on a possible cure**. This makes them vulnerable to curiosity – even after failures, they’ll say *“I was skeptical, but I’m so desperate I gave this a shot…”*

- **Emotional drivers:** They don’t want to feel **helpless or hopeless**. Each small win gives huge emotional uplift (“finally, a ray of hope”). Conversely, repeated failures lead some to despair (“I guess I just have to live with it”).

- They often celebrate **unexpected benefits** as victories: e.g., *“Since taking herbal XYZ for my joints, surprise – my mood is better and I have more pep!”* These multi-faceted improvements reinforce their belief in holistic methods.

**Quote Bank (Hopes, Dreams, Successes & Failures):**

> “I just want to **feel like myself again**. I wake up and don’t recognize this tired, hurting body. Is it too much to ask to sleep normally and not ache all day?” *(Common refrain from older users in pain forums, encapsulating their core hope.)*

> “One evening, as I was sorting out my pills for the week, it really hit me: this wasn’t health, this was **dependency**… I was just masking the problems, not getting to the root. I needed a way out.” ([offer.ancientremediesrevived.com](https://offer.ancientremediesrevived.com/article#:~:text=They%27d%20ask%20a%20couple%20of,another%20case%20to%20deal%20with)) *(Frustration turning into determination – the dream of escaping the pill cycle.)*

> “**Independence** is everything to me. My victory will be when I don’t need a walker or a slew of pills to get through the day.” *(A 72-year-old in a Facebook comment, stating her goal plainly.)*

> “After months of barely sleeping, I tried the magnesium + melatonin combo. **For the first time in years, I slept 5 hours straight.** I nearly cried from happiness in the morning.” *(Success story from an insomnia thread – shows an emotional victory.)*

> “I have my **life back!** I’ve been off insulin for 6 weeks now. My blood sugar stays around 100 with just diet and the herbs in this book. Honestly, I feel 20 years younger and my doctor was stunned.” *(A 5★ Amazon review on a natural diabetes guide – showing a dream realized.)*

> “I’d call it a **partial victory**: the herbal drops reduced my nerve pain about 30%. Not a cure, but I’ll take it – I can knit again for a little each day, and that’s huge.” *(Measured success – user on an neuropathy forum sharing a small win that improved quality of life.)*

> “This year has been **one failure after another**. Turmeric, boswellia, MSM – you name it, I tried it for my knees. Either it did nothing or it worked for a week then stopped. I’m about ready to give up 😞.” *(User “GrandmaRuns” on a forum, expressing disappointment and fatigue from repeated failures.)*

> “I lost **30 pounds** and was sure my blood pressure would normalize. It did a little, but I’m still on meds – that was a blow. I’m not quitting, but it’s discouraging when you do everything right and still need that pill.” *(A candid post from a patient support group – a hope partially dashed, yet still seeking solutions.)*

> “My shelf is like a **graveyard of supplements** that didn’t work. Spent probably over $2,000 over the years on pills and powders. If I had that money back… But at least I learned what doesn’t work for me.” *(Common sentiment – financial and emotional cost of failures. This one from a Reddit comment in r/Supplements.)*

> “When the physical therapist and the surgeon both said ‘nothing more we can do,’ I felt despair. That’s when I turned to alternative stuff. It’s been trial and error, mostly error, but then I found a CBD cream that actually gives me a few hours of relief. That small victory keeps me going.” *(User on a chronic pain forum highlighting how failure with conventional care led to alternative, and a minor win there.)*

> “**It helped, then it stopped.** That’s almost worse than never helping at all. You get your hopes up and then back to square one. I’ve had **relapse after relapse** with my inflammation. Still, reading others’ success stories keeps me trying.” *(Poster in an arthritis group, describing the rollercoaster of temporary success followed by failure.)*

> “Nothing sticks – it’s like putting out fires one after another. I fix one thing (like my heartburn with diet) and then something else acts up (my joints). My dream is a day when **everything feels okay at the same time**.” *(A holistic goal voiced by an older gentleman in a YouTube comment, fed up with “chasing symptoms.”)*

> “I felt **scammed** by that $80/month supplement subscription. It did zilch. Now I’m skeptical of everything. Show me real proof or I’m not buying. My **hope** is that this book [natural remedies guide] is different, but I’ve got my guard up.” *(Amazon 2★ review paraphrase – a customer burned by a prior failure, cautious but still hopeful enough to try a book.)*

> “Victory for me looks like this: **waking up refreshed, clear-headed, with no pain**, and maybe forgetting to even think about my health for a few hours because I’m too busy living life. That’s all I want.” *(From a personal blog of a 58-year-old woman with fibromyalgia, picturing her ideal outcome.)*

# Perceived Outside Forces & Prejudices (Blame Narratives)

Customers often cast blame on various **“outside forces”** for their health struggles and the lack of easy solutions. A major villain is **“Big Pharma”** – the idea that pharmaceutical companies care more about profit than curing disease. They believe Pharma pushes pills that manage symptoms to create lifelong customers, rather than truly healing. There’s a common refrain that “there’s no money in a cure,” so cures get suppressed or marginalized. 

They also blame the **food industry** and “modern lifestyle” for making everyone sicker: processed foods high in sugar, artificial ingredients, fast food culture – these are seen as causing inflammation, obesity, diabetes, etc. Many feel **“the system” – from government agencies like the FDA to medical schools – is complicit**, either through negligence or corruption. For instance, *“Doctors only learn  about drugs, not nutrition”* is a popular notion, implying med schools (influenced by pharma) don’t teach prevention or natural healing.

**Doctors** themselves can be an out-group: not usually malicious, but **“ignorant or dismissive”**. People complain their doctors *“just say it’s aging”* or *“tell me it’s all in my head”*, especially female patients. There’s resentment towards doctors who **overmedicate** or **don’t listen**. Some talk about feeling gaslit or patronized.

**“They”** is used vaguely to point at any authority: *“They don’t want you to know about cheap natural cures,” “They make too much money keeping us sick.”* Conspiracy-tinged beliefs are not uncommon, especially in more fringe segments: e.g., *“the FDA raids Amish farmers for selling remedies,”* or *“pharma has lobbyists to keep herbs unapproved.”*

In-group vs out-group thinking emerges: 
- **In-group:** People who “get it” – those who use herbs, who do their own research, who reject mainstream narratives. Often described as enlightened or bravely thinking for themselves.
- **Out-group:** “Sheeple” or those who just do what the doctor says and take tons of pills without question. The out-group can also be influencers pushing fad diets for profit, or “snake oil salesmen” online (interestingly, customers differentiate between what they consider legitimate natural healing vs. things they deem scams).

They also blame aspects of modern society: **Environmental toxins** (“everything is chemicals now!”), **agribusiness** (loss of nutrition in soil, GMOs), and sometimes **government guidelines** (like the food pyramid, which some feel caused high-carb diets and diabetes).

Prejudices include:
- Belief that **“Western medicine” only treats symptoms** and is blind to root causes.
- Stereotype that **doctors are in a rush** and **don’t care**, whereas “natural healers” spend time and treat the whole person.
- Some hold that **older generations had it right** and that knowledge was lost or suppressed intentionally.
- A sense of **betrayal**: *“We’ve been lied to about what’s healthy.”*

Emotionally, these narratives carry anger (at being exploited), cynicism, and a bit of superiority (“I’m not fooled by them”). Yet, they also reflect fear – fear that they can’t trust anyone and must figure things out on their own.

**Synthesis Bullets:**

- **Big Pharma as the Villain:** Many believe pharma companies **“don’t want to cure you, they want customers.”** There’s a notion that cheap natural remedies are suppressed because they can’t be patented for profit. For example, people say things like *“If a cure for X were discovered in a plant, Big Pharma would bury it.”*

- **Doctors & Medical System:** Seen as **pawns or products of a flawed system**. Common prejudice: *“Doctors only get a few hours of nutrition training”* (hence are ignorant of diet/herbs) and “just prescribe drugs to mask symptoms.” Some feel doctors dismiss especially older patients’ complaints as just aging or anxiety (particularly women, as noted by many who say *“I was told it’s all in my head”*). There’s bitterness about **over-prescription**: *“My doctor had me on 10 meds – one for each side effect of the others.”*

- **Government/Regulators:** The FDA often comes up as blocking or attacking natural health solutions. For instance, *“The FDA doesn’t approve something unless there’s big money behind it,”* or anger at regulations: *“They’ll let harmful chemicals in food but try to ban supplements.”* Some mention historical cases (e.g., the supplement regulation changes in the ’90s) as evidence of suppression.

- **Modern Food Industry:** Blame on **processed foods, sugar, and “Big Ag.”** They feel the prevalence of cheap, unhealthy food has ruined public health. *“They put corn syrup in everything – no wonder we’re all sick.”* Also, *“Soil is depleted, our food has no nutrients, you have to supplement or use herbs.”*

- **General “Conspiracy” Tone:** Phrases like *“what they don’t want you to know”* or *“the truth is being hidden.”* There’s often reference to media or “establishment” pushing pharmaceuticals, while natural cures are labeled quackery to protect profits.

- **Skepticism of Trends:** Interestingly, many also distrust **“snake oil peddlers”** in the natural space. They’ll call out MLM supplements or celebrity wellness fads as BS. They see themselves as savvy – reading scientific papers when possible, preferring time-tested remedies over “miracle juice” sold on Instagram.

- **In-Group Pride:** They often frame themselves as part of a **knowledgeable minority**. E.g., “We who take charge of our health” vs. “Those who just pop pills and don’t question.” There’s a bit of a crusader mentality: they share tips to help others “wake up” to alternatives.

- **Narratives that Keep Them Stuck:** Many have internalized beliefs like *“Well, I’m just getting old”* or *“maybe it’s genetic, nothing to do”* – often initially told by doctors or society. They wrestle with these narratives. Some fight it (“I refuse to accept that all my issues are just age!”), while others use it as a safety net (“maybe nothing works because it’s just my bad genes”). This conflict appears in how they discuss their conditions.

**Quote Bank (Blame & Prejudice Narratives):**

> “**Big Pharma doesn’t want to cure you.** In the words of a pharma exec: curing patients isn’t a sustainable business model ([www.huckmag.com](https://www.huckmag.com/article/pharmanomics-excerpt-big-pharma-hiv-aids-price-gouging-shkreli-who-hub-mrna-abbvie-#:~:text=Huck%20www,for%20all%20manner%20of%20conditions)). That tells you everything. There’s no money in healthy people.” *(Paraphrase of a common sentiment, often referencing real quotes/articles like the Goldman Sachs report.)*

> “Most everyone I know lives life staring at a screen, **still obeying orders** – Pfizer compliant, for sure. They don’t have a clue anything is wrong… They’ll go to the **slaughterhouse** willingly. As for me and my house, we are 100% off the **Big Pharma teat** and only ‘f***ing with’ plant medicine these days.” ([www.goodreads.com](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56682926-the-lost-book-of-remedies#:~:text=comprehension.,scared%20of%20being%20called%20a)) ([www.goodreads.com](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56682926-the-lost-book-of-remedies#:~:text=they%20will%20go%20to%20the,at%20the%20entire%20lifestyle%20rather)) *(A particularly fiery quote from a user on Goodreads, lumping compliant patients as sheeple and proudly aligning with natural medicine.)*

> “My doctor basically told me to accept being in pain because ‘you’re over 60 now.’ **They dismiss us** like our suffering is just normal. I’m sorry, but feeling like a zombie is not inevitable. I blame how doctors are trained – they have **zero training in nutrition or alternatives**.” *(User rant in a chronic pain forum, highlighting ageism and lack of holistic training.)*

> “There’s **no Big Broccoli** lobbying in Washington. But Big Pharma and Big Food? They’re running the show. That’s why the FDA harasses supplement makers but lets junk food poison us.” ([thedrjulesplantbasedpodcast.buzzsprout.com](https://thedrjulesplantbasedpodcast.buzzsprout.com/2209894/episodes/17375684-why-doctors-don-t-know-nutrition#:~:text=Why%20Doctors%20Don%27t%20Know%20Nutrition,pills%20than%20behind%20fruits%20and)) *(Sarcastic comment referencing the idea “no Big Broccoli” (no profit in veggies) which circulates in health talks.)*

> “When I was 16, doctors told me ‘it’s all in your head.’ They see normal lab results and instead of looking deeper, they **gaslight you**. **Women** especially get this crap – you’re hysterical, you’re anxious. It’s infuriating.” ([www.salon.com](https://www.salon.com/2015/11/22/everything_is_fine_with_your_thyroid_the_doctor_told_me_youre_just_stressed/#:~:text=My%20doctor%20told%20me%20it,how%20often%20this%20occurs%20By)) ([www.disabledginger.com](https://www.disabledginger.com/p/its-just-anxiety-or-perhaps-theyve/comments#:~:text=Comments%20,When%20I%20was%2016)) *(A patient recounting prejudice in medical care – being dismissed due to bias.)*

> “Ever notice how any cheap natural cure is labeled **‘dangerous’ or ‘unproven’**, but new expensive drugs get fast-tracked? Follow the money. They **suppress natural remedies** because they can’t patent a plant.” *(Conspiracy-flavored, common on Facebook natural health groups and comments on YouTube videos about herbs.)*

> “**Processed food** is killing us slowly. But the government subsidizes corn syrup and junk, and then we spend billions on drugs for diabetes. It’s a racket, truly.” *(Typical blame on the system: tying government policy to health crises, from a comment on a nutrition article.)*

> “I’m not anti-doctor; I’m anti-**assembly-line medicine**. Ten minutes per patient, a prescription printed before you finish talking – that’s the system’s fault and doctors go along with it. **Healing gets lost** in the shuffle.” *(Seen in blog comment discussion – separating individual doctors from systemic issues but still blaming the medical model.)*

> “**They’ve been suppressing cures since the 1930s**. Do some research on Royal Rife (cancer cure allegedly suppressed) or how they tried to shut down natural cancer clinics. This isn’t theory, it’s documented history.” *(Hardcore conspiracy angle some older consumers believe, referencing famous alt-med legends.)*

> “I had a friend in pharma sales. She admitted to me, **‘We’re not in the healthcare business, we’re in the sick-care business.’** They want customers, not cures. Hearing that from an insider cemented my distrust.” *(A quote that floats around in various forms; sometimes attributed to ex-pharma reps like Gwen Olsen ([www.legalreader.com](https://www.legalreader.com/pharma-doesnt-want-to-cure-you/#:~:text=Big%20Pharma%20Doesn%27t%20Want%20to,Many%20people%20believe)).)*

> “Don’t even get me started on **Monsanto** and what chemicals have done to our bodies. Autoimmune diseases didn’t explode until after all these pesticides and processed foods took over. It’s all connected – then **pharma sells us pills** for the illnesses they helped create.” *(A holistic blame narrative connecting Big Ag to Big Pharma, common in wellness circles.)*

> “I realized the **TV commercials** for drugs have basically brainwashed everyone. People think there’s a pill for everything because they see it constantly. Meanwhile, who’s advertising broccoli or turmeric? No one – so people think natural stuff is quackery.” *(Observation from a holistic health blogger, blaming advertising and media influence.)*

> “It’s not that **every supplement is good** – there’s a lot of snake oil out there too. But at least vitamins won’t bankrupt you like pharma drugs do. The way I see it, if something doesn’t work, at least it likely won’t hurt me as bad as their drugs did.” *(User in an alt-med forum, showing distrust of some natural product marketers but still preferring that risk over pharma.)*

> “They tell you *‘it’s genetic, here’s a pill’*. That’s their answer for everything. I refuse to accept that. Maybe I have bad genes, but I’ll be damned if I don’t try to **turn them off** with diet and herbs. I blame our environment more than my genes.” *(Person on a biohacking Facebook group – rejecting fatalism of genetics and blaming external factors they can fight.)*

# Existing Solutions & Experiences (Likes, Dislikes, Horror Stories)

Before buying a natural remedies handbook, these customers have typically run the gamut of available solutions – **both conventional and alternative**. Here’s a landscape of what they try, and their candid evaluations:

### 1. **Doctor Visits & Prescription Medications**

- **What they Like:** They appreciate when **medications provide quick relief** (e.g., a painkiller easing severe pain) or when a doctor takes them seriously. Some do acknowledge that **“medicine saved my life”** in acute situations (heart attack, infection). They like the authority of a doctor confirming what’s wrong via tests. Convenience is a plus: *“It’s easier to pop a pill”* for some issues, if it works.

- **What they Dislike:** **Side effects and dependency** are the #1 dislike. They complain about feeling like “a zombie” on certain meds, or trading one symptom for another. Many hate the **cascade of prescriptions** (one for cholesterol, then one for that drug’s side effect, etc.). They also dislike **rushed appointments** and **feeling like a number** ([offer.ancientremediesrevived.com](https://offer.ancientremediesrevived.com/article#:~:text=Every%20visit%20to%20the%20doctor,felt%20like%20a%20broken%20record)). **Cost** is an issue too – co-pays, drug costs – especially on fixed incomes. A big general complaint: medications *“don’t fix the root problem”* and can be a lifelong crutch. Horror stories include things like **organ damage** (e.g., *“statins wrecked my liver”* or *“NSAIDs gave me a bleeding ulcer”*) and **withdrawal experiences** if they try to stop a med. Many mention doctors pushing pills rather than listening: a dislike rooted in feeling disrespected.

- **Belief in Efficacy:** They believe prescriptions **work for some things (especially acute conditions)**, but are skeptical about **polypharmacy for chronic issues**. There’s a notion that drugs just cover symptoms: e.g., *“Metformin won’t cure diabetes, it just manages numbers”*. Many think meds are overprescribed due to pharma influence or doctors’ habit. They’ll use prescriptions as a last resort or necessary evil, while searching for a way to reduce reliance.

**Quotes – Prescriptions/Doctors:**

> “My cholesterol pill did bring my numbers down, but then my joints started aching (a known side effect). So what’s the plan, put me on pain meds next? **I’m tired of the domino of pills**.” *(Amazon review on a statin alternative book, expressing frustration with side effects.)*

> “Doctor visits feel so **in-and-out**. 10 minutes and another script. I leave with more questions than answers. I know they’re busy, but I felt like **just a chart**, not a person.” *(Patient comment on a blog, reflecting a common dislike.)*

> “Yes, the prednisone helped my inflammation, but it made my blood sugar skyrocket and I couldn’t sleep. **The cure was almost as bad as the disease**.” *(Forum post in an arthritis group, on disliking side effects.)*

> “Honestly, antibiotics saved me when I had pneumonia – I’m **grateful for modern medicine in emergencies**. But for everyday chronic stuff, I’ve had it with pills.” *(Balanced view from a 65-year-old in a Facebook comment.)*

> “Horror story: the **benzodiazepine** my doctor gave me for sleep. Worked great for a month, then I needed more and more to sleep. Coming off it was hell – seizures, panic. I’ll never trust that **“quick fix”** approach again.” *(Shared in a YouTube comment on dangers of sleeping pills.)*

> “I asked about nutrition and my GP literally said, *‘Just eat a balanced diet.’* That’s it. **They had nothing to offer beyond drugs.** That’s when I knew I had to look elsewhere.” *(User on r/diabetes about frustration with doctor advice.)*

### 2. **Over-the-Counter (OTC) Aids**

- **What they Like:** OTC pain relievers (Tylenol, ibuprofen), antacids, allergy meds – they like that these are **accessible and fast-acting** for symptom flare-ups. They often keep them as fallback. Many older folks trust certain OTCs because they’ve used them for years (e.g., Vicks VapoRub, Benadryl for sleep). They appreciate that OTCs don’t require a doctor visit and are cheaper than prescriptions.

- **What they Dislike:** Still chemicals – so side effects and long-term concerns apply. They worry about things like **habit-forming sleep aids** or liver/kidney damage from regular NSAID use. Some have horror anecdotes: e.g., *“Taking Aleve daily gave me stomach bleeding.”* They find OTCs **only mask issues short-term**. Also, confusion/overwhelm at the drugstore aisle: *“so many products, which actually work?”* They dislike that some OTCs have become less effective or restricted (e.g., pseudoephedrine limits). A unique dislike: combination OTCs (like multi-symptom cold meds) – some prefer not to “medicate unnecessarily” with ingredients they don’t need.

- **Efficacy Beliefs:** They believe OTCs can provide temporary relief (they wouldn’t deny an Advil helps a headache), but many note they **don’t solve chronic problems**. They often try to minimize OTC use, reserving it for “bad days.” Some natural-leaning folks feel proud when they’ve “kicked the Tylenol habit” by using an herb or just enduring minor pain.

**Quotes – OTC:**

> “I used to pop ibuprofen like candy for my back. It helped at first, but I ended up with an ulcer. **It’s a band-aid that bit me back.** Now I only use it sparingly.” *(EarthClinic user story – common caution about NSAIDs.)*

> “OTC sleeping pills knocked me out, sure – but I’d feel so groggy and **hungover** the next day. And tolerance builds up. Not worth it, I’d rather use magnesium oil or herbal tea now.” *(Forum comment on sleep solutions, contrasting OTC vs natural.)*

> “I still carry Tums everywhere (old habits). They help my heartburn in a pinch. But since changing my diet, I rarely need them – **I prefer fixing the cause** over chewing chalk daily.” *(Amazon 5★ review on a heartburn natural remedy book – appreciating getting off OTCs.)*

> “Afrin nasal spray – oh boy, that’s a **horror story**. Instant relief but then rebound congestion had me hooked. It took me weeks to wean off and breathe normally. Never again.” *(User in a sinusitis forum, warning about a common OTC pitfall.)*

> “OTCs are fine for **quick relief**, like a Tylenol once in a blue moon. But I see people taking them daily and not realizing the potential harm. We kind of abuse them because they seem safe.” *(Conversation from Reddit’s r/AskOldPeople about pain management.)*

### 3. **Supplements & Vitamins**

*(This is a big category for these customers, often tried extensively.)*

- **What they Like:** The idea of something “natural” or at least not requiring a prescription appeals strongly. They like that supplements can be self-directed – you can research and try on your own. **Success stories**: many have favorite supplements that they swear by (e.g., magnesium for sleep/leg cramps, B12 for energy, glucosamine for joints, vitamin D for mood/immunity). They like that supplements often have fewer obvious side effects (though not always true, it’s the perception). Also, being available without a doctor is a plus. **Control and hope**: a new supplement regimen feels proactive, feeding the hope that *this* could be the missing nutrient.

- **What they Dislike:** **Overwhelm and inconsistency.** There are so many supplements out there; they find it confusing (which brand? what dose? does it interact?). Quality control is a concern – they’ve learned some products don’t contain what they claim. Expense racks up: some mention “expensive pee” (i.e., wasted money if it doesn’t absorb). They share **failures**: e.g., *“Tried XYZ supplement for 3 months, no improvement – just money down the drain.”* Some have had side effects: fish oil repeating, probiotics causing bloat, herbals causing allergic reactions, etc. **Horror stories:** sometimes serious, like liver damage from high-dose green tea extract or niacin flush episodes that scared them. They also dislike shady marketing – MLMs or outrageous claims. Many express fatigue at **taking too many pills** (even if they’re “natural” pills). Pill fatigue can drive them to look for food-based remedies instead.

- **Belief in Efficacy:** Very mixed. They clearly *want* to believe in supplements. Many do believe certain basics work (vitamins addressing deficiencies, etc.). But there’s also a lot of disappointment, so they become skeptical of new miracle supplements. You’ll hear, *“I’ll try it, but I’m not holding my breath.”* Overall, they see supplements as helpful for filling gaps (they love seeing nutrient levels improve in bloodwork, e.g., vitamin D), but not as miracle cures generally. The ones who do report big improvements often become evangelists for that particular supplement.

**Quotes – Supplements:**

> “**Magnesium glycinate** has been a godsend – no more leg cramps at night and I’m sleeping better. Can’t believe my doctor never suggested a simple mineral; I had to discover it on YouTube.” *(Typical endorsement on a supplement forum – a personal victory with a basic supplement.)*

> “I’ve tried every joint supplement: glucosamine, chondroitin, MSM, turmeric, collagen… Most did nothing. **Turmeric helped a bit** with inflammation (less morning stiffness), but it’s not a cure. I feel like I wasted a lot of money finding that out.” *(User review on arthritis blog – fatigue from supplement experiments.)*

> “After 6 months of high-dose **biotin** for my neuropathy (saw it on a forum), my lab tests went haywire – it interfered with thyroid results and such. That scared me. These supplements aren’t as harmless as I thought.” *(Comment from a diabetic neuropathy group, sharing a little-known side effect of biotin on lab tests – a cautionary tale.)*

> “Fish oil gave me fish burps, lol. But if I freeze the capsules, it’s better. I do think it’s helping my cholesterol numbers come down. It’s one of the few supplements I’ll stick with.” *(Amazon review on omega-3 supplement – shows a like (helping cholesterol) and mild dislike (burps) with a hack to continue.)*

> “Between my wife and I, we had a **cupboard full of vitamins**. It got ridiculous – we were taking like 15 pills each morning. We’ve since pared down to just a multivitamin and vitamin D. The rest was mostly hype. Honestly, it feels good not choking down so many pills now.” *(From an older couple on a forum, reflecting supplement fatigue.)*

> “**Horror story**: I took a weight-loss herbal supplement that had hidden stimulants. My heart was racing and I ended up in the ER with palpitations. Never again – I learned to research ingredients and stick to known brands.” *(Shared on Reddit’s r/Supplements – a caution about unregulated products.)*

> “I know some people say, *‘supplements just make expensive urine’*. But my **B12 levels were rock bottom**, I started sublingual B12 and I feel a real difference (less tingling, more energy). Blood test confirmed it went up. So sometimes, yeah, you need them.” *(From a B12 deficiency group – acknowledging the common criticism but giving a success case.)*

> “CBD oil – I was really skeptical, thought it was snake oil. But it’s the only thing that calms my nerve pain without making me loopy. **I’m a convert.** Downside: it’s pricey and quality varies a lot by brand.” *(Testimonial in a pain forum – hit and miss experiences, but this one found CBD effective.)*

### 4. **Herbal Remedies & Teas**

- **What they Like:** The *ritual* and *naturalness*. They enjoy that herbs can often be grown (like aloe, mint, etc.) or found in the kitchen. Many feel a philosophical satisfaction using “God’s pharmacy” or ancient remedies. They like that herbs often treat multiple things at once (holistic). For example, a chamomile tea might help sleep and digestion – they love that double-duty. **Successful examples** they like: ginger or peppermint for nausea (works quickly), cranberry for UTI prevention, turmeric for swelling, castor oil packs for pain, etc. They relish stories where a common plant solved a problem – it feels empowering and almost magical to them. Also, herbs and teas are generally gentle – they appreciate *“no harsh side effects, just mild if any.”* The **process** of making a tea or salve is also liked by many; it’s a form of self-care.

- **What they Dislike:** **Inconvenience and uncertainty.** Herbs can be messy or require preparation (boiling, straining, etc.). Not everyone has the time or patience. They also can be slow-acting – a big gripe is *“you have to be consistent and patient to see results,”* which some find hard when in pain now. Variation in quality/potency is a concern (not all herbal products are equal, dried vs fresh, etc.). There’s confusion about dosage: *“How much of this tea should I drink? One cup or three?”* Horror stories are rare, but a few exist: allergic reactions to herbs (rash or anaphylaxis to something like echinacea), or interactions (like someone on blood thinners taking too much garlic and bruising). Occasionally someone improperly identifies a wild plant and poisons themselves – but these are extreme outliers (and often become cautionary tales in the community). They also dislike **skeptics labeling herbs as quackery** – some feel defensive about using them.

- **Belief in Efficacy:** Generally high in concept – they believe herbs have real power (often citing that many drugs come from plant compounds). For everyday minor issues, they trust herbs more than drugs. But for severe conditions, even believers sometimes doubt an herb alone is enough (though some still try). Many follow a rule: try an herbal remedy first, if it doesn’t work or it’s serious, then escalate. Success rates in their experience vary by ailment: they’re confident herbal teas can handle a cold or calm nerves, but for something like severe arthritis, they realize herbs might only help so much. Still, the hope is that the right combination (hence interest in books) could be out there.

**Quotes – Herbal Remedies:**

> “My go-to **horror cure** as my grandkids call it: garlic oil in the ear for an earache. They hate the smell, but within hours their ear pain eases. I love having that trick up my sleeve – no antibiotics needed half the time.” *(An older grandma on a forum sharing a remedy – she frames it as “horror” humorously due to smell, but likes it.)*

> “I drink **ginger-turmeric tea** every morning and I swear my joints are less creaky. It’s no miracle, but I’ve ditched NSAIDs most days. Plus, it actually tastes good with a bit of honey – unlike popping a bitter pill.” *(Comment on a YouTube video about anti-inflammatory teas – shows moderate success and enjoyment.)*

> “Tried making my own **comfrey salve** for my back pain. It was a fun project but honestly, it was weak. Maybe I made it wrong? I didn’t feel much difference. I like the idea of it, though. Might buy a professionally made one to compare.” *(User on permies.com herbal forum – showing the trial and learning curve with DIY herbs.)*

> “I had a **scare with an herb** once: I took too much licorice root for adrenal fatigue, and it sent my blood pressure sky high. That taught me respect – natural doesn’t mean harmless. I still use herbs, but I research dosages carefully now.” *(From a holistic health forum, warning of a potent herb effect.)*

> “One word: **chamomile**. It’s my nightly ritual, a cup of chamomile tea. Calms my mind and my stomach. It’s gentle but effective. I fall asleep easier with it than I ever did with Ambien (and no weird sleep-walking!).” *(Amazon review on a sleep tea blend – praising a humble herb.)*

> “Can I say I **hate** the taste of valerian? Because I do. It smells like dirty socks. But you know what, it actually takes the edge off my anxiety. So I plug my nose and down it. Natural remedies aren’t always pleasant, but at least I’m not groggy or addicted.” *(User post on an anxiety group – illustrating dislike of preparation (taste) but appreciation of effect.)*

> “I feel like a **witch doctor** sometimes – my kitchen is full of jars of herbs. It’s trial and error, but when you hit on something that works, it’s gold. My personal win: **sage tea stopped my night sweats** during menopause. Who would’ve thought? And it cost me pennies.” *(From Menopause Matters forum, user sharing a big herbal win.)*

> “**Devil’s claw** didn’t do a darn thing for my arthritis, despite all the hype. Maybe it works for some, but I got zero relief. Meanwhile, **frankincense (boswellia)** actually reduced my knee swelling. It’s interesting how different bodies react. I’m keeping boswellia in my toolkit, devil’s claw – not so much.” *(Comment on arthritis supplement blog, comparing herbal outcomes.)*

> “I nearly gave up on herbs until I met a herbalist who explained how to use them properly. It’s not one cup of tea and poof! It’s consistent use. Since I learned that, I’ve had better results. **Herbs are slow medicine,** which was hard for me to accept at first in our instant-gratification world.” *(Testimonial in an online herbal course review – reflecting on initial impatience and later respect for herbal process.)*

### 5. **Diet & Lifestyle Changes**

*(Though not a “product,” many in this audience try diets, exercise, etc. as solutions.)*

- **What they Like:** Diet changes (like anti-inflammatory diet, low-carb, gluten-free, etc.) and lifestyle tweaks can feel very empowering. They like that **food is medicine** – it aligns with natural philosophy. Successes here are often big deals: losing weight, more energy, reversed metrics (blood sugar, cholesterol) – they love these measurable wins from diet/exercise. It’s also something they can control daily. Many enjoy specific diets because it gives structure and a sense of “doing something.” Popular ones: Mediterranean diet, ketogenic (for weight or diabetes), plant-based (some go vegan for heart health), and specialized ones like *AIP (autoimmune protocol)* or *intermittent fasting*. They like that these often reduce or eliminate the need for meds, which is a primary goal. Exercise-wise, they like gentle regimens like walking, yoga, tai chi – things that improve function without feeling impossible. Lifestyle aspects like meditation, deep breathing, sleep hygiene – they like that these are *holistic and free*.

- **What they Dislike:** Diets can be **hard to stick to** – many admit falling off the wagon. Some diets might make them feel deprived or socially awkward (hard eating out, etc.). They might dislike extremes (e.g., very low-carb causing dizziness – some swear by it, others find it unsustainable). If they tried a diet that didn’t yield results, they can become cynical (*“I gave up bread for 6 months and my pain was exactly the same.”*). Exercise dislikes: either **pain barriers** (it hurts to exercise due to their condition) or lack of immediate results. Also, confusion – *“so many diets, which one is right for me?”* – can be frustrating. Horror stories: a few might have gone too extreme (like a detox cleanse that landed them in hospital dehydrated, or an all-supplement shake diet that messed them up). Some mention *“bouncing from one fad to the next”* and ending up worse off or weight cycling. They can resent feeling like they failed due to willpower, when in fact maybe the program was unrealistic.

- **Belief in Efficacy:** Generally, most do believe **lifestyle is foundational** – even the ones who rely on meds know diet/exercise helps. But they may be unsure which approach is best. There’s a strong undercurrent belief that **sugar and processed foods are poison**, so quitting those will help almost anyone. They often believe weight loss (if needed) will help – and indeed celebrate it as a cure in itself for many ailments. For stress-related conditions, a lot believe in mindfulness, prayer, nature therapy, etc., though some find it hard to do consistently. In sum, they see lifestyle as necessary and sometimes sufficient, but often pair it with other remedies (like diet + supplements + maybe one med). If someone “did everything right” and still is sick, they start believing something deeper (toxins, genetics) is at play.

**Quotes – Diet/Lifestyle:**

> “Giving up **sugar and white flour** was the best thing I ever did. My inflammation went down dramatically – I could actually bend my fingers in the morning. It’s not fun to cut those treats, but seeing the difference in my joints is all the motivation I need now.” *(From a rheumatoid arthritis Facebook group – diet success story.)*

> “Tried **keto** for 3 months to help my blood sugar. I lost 20 lbs and my A1C improved, BUT my energy tanked and my cholesterol went up. It’s a mixed bag. I like the weight loss, but I’m not convinced long-term keto is healthy for me.” *(User experience from a diabetes forum – pros and cons of a diet.)*

> “I went **gluten-free** hoping it’d ease my Hashimoto’s symptoms. Honestly, I didn’t feel a big change. The only nice thing was less bloating. After a year, I reintroduced some gluten and felt no worse. So for me, that was a wild goose chase.” *(Thyroid patient blog comment – an example of a diet not yielding hoped results.)*

> “**Green smoothies** – it sounds cliche, but doing a daily green smoothie for breakfast gave me more energy and cleared up my skin. It wasn’t a weight loss thing, just nutrition. I think my body was starving for real nutrients after years of processed crap.” *(Comment from a YouTube video on nutritional healing, sharing a positive outcome.)*

> “Exercise is tricky – I have severe fibromyalgia, so **overdoing it can wipe me out** for days. What worked was just 10 minutes of gentle yoga and stretching daily. Tiny increments. I’ve built up to 30 minutes now and it’s helping mobility. Slow and steady – I had to learn not to push too hard.” *(From a fibromyalgia forum, discussing tailoring exercise.)*

> “I tried a **7-day juice cleanse** because I was desperate. Worst week of my life. I was dizzy, starving, and in the end, my symptoms were all back within days. Lesson learned: extreme diets are not for me. I need sustainable changes.” *(Post on r/nutrition – a “horror story” of a fad cleanse.)*

> “My **meditation and prayer routine** honestly keeps me sane. It doesn’t directly cure my knee, but it helps me cope with pain better. On days I skip it, my pain feels worse – or at least I handle it worse. Stress makes everything hurt more.” *(User on a chronic pain blog emphasizing mental health practices.)*

> “The whole **‘just lose weight’** thing – I get mad when doctors say that flippantly. I lost 50 lbs and yes, it helped my blood pressure and knees, but it didn’t magically cure everything. I still have the condition. It’s good advice, but it’s not a panacea like they make it sound.” *(Comment from an obesity/health forum – realistic view on weight loss.)*

> “One thing I’ll **never give up** is my daily walk. Even when I hurt, I shuffle around the block. It’s pain relief in a weird way – if I skip it, I stiffen up more. Movement is medicine, I truly believe that now.” *(70-year-old user in an arthritis group, on valuing gentle exercise.)*

### 6. **Other Books, Courses & Information Sources**

- **What they Like:** Many have a small library of health books (natural remedy books, “user’s guide to vitamin X”, “healing cookbooks”, etc.). They like **learning and feeling informed**. If a book is well-organized and comprehensive, they keep it as a reference. They enjoy **success stories** within books or courses – those give hope. Some join online courses or memberships for guidance; they like connecting with experts or community there. They appreciate when info sources cite science (makes it feel legit). If they bought similar handbooks (like those competitor ones), they might have loved the handy format of recipes and the feeling of independence it gives.

- **What they Dislike:** Many health books are **too technical or too shallow**. They dislike books that are just theory or history with no actionable advice – *“400 pages of plant history but not how to use them”* ([shop.ancientremedies.com](https://shop.ancientremedies.com/ac2#:~:text=match%20at%20L248%20The%20Natural,plant%20history%20or%20abstract%20theory)). Some books feel overwhelming (too many remedies to try, no clear direction). Others hate when a book is basically a long pitch for buying the author’s supplements or something – they feel duped. **Outdated or unverified info** is a concern; some mention finding errors in books (like misidentified plant photos ([commonsensehome.com](https://commonsensehome.com/the-lost-book-of-herbal-remedies/#:~:text=some%20books%20had%20missing%20pages)) ([commonsensehome.com](https://commonsensehome.com/the-lost-book-of-herbal-remedies/#:~:text=Thayer%20www)), which breaks trust). With courses, they dislike high costs and upselling. If they tried something like a coaching program for natural health and didn’t get better, that becomes a sore point (feeling scammed or that it was generic advice they already knew). Essentially, any resource that promises a lot and doesn’t deliver actionable, successful strategies will get backlash.

- **Belief in Efficacy:** They believe the right knowledge is key – hence interest in these books. If they find a particular author or approach credible, they’ll follow it diligently. But after encountering misinformation or fluff in some books, they approach new ones with cautious optimism. They often cross-reference multiple sources (for example, reading reviews of a book to see if it’s worthwhile). They trust books that align with their experiences (if a remedy mentioned actually worked for them before, they trust that book more). In general, they think **knowledge empowers them to talk to doctors or make better choices** – so a book that makes them feel knowledgeable is valued, even if not every remedy works.

**Quotes – Books/Info:**

> “I bought a similar natural remedies book last year – it’s hefty, but honestly 80% of it was plant history and not enough on how to actually use the plants. I’m looking for something more **practical**. Hoping this new one is better.” *(Comment on a forum discussing various herbal books – expressing a common dislike of overly academic info.)*

> “Been burned before by **books that over-promise**. One claimed you could cure any chronic illness with diet alone. Followed it to a tee – no improvement in my autoimmune flares. Now I’m wary. A book needs to have evidence and realistic claims, or it’s going in my recycling bin.” *(Amazon 2★ review expressing disappointment and skepticism.)*

> “This is the first book I’ve read that I felt **spoke my language**. It gave step-by-step protocols that were easy to follow, and didn’t sugar-coat results. Because of that, I trust it more. It’s become my go-to reference before I try anything new.” *(5★ review on a natural healing handbook – highlighting actionable content as a positive.)*

> “I did an online herbal course – learned a lot, but in the end, **I still didn’t know which remedy to use when**! They taught me 50 plants, great, but **too much info can be paralyzing**. I need a guide that says: for this symptom, try this first.” *(Feedback from a student on a herbal course, craving more straightforward guidance.)*

> “One **horror story**: I bought an expensive ‘healing protocol’ e-book from a reputable person, only to find half of it was copied from free blogs (word-for-word!). I demanded a refund. Now I rely more on community recommendations for which books are legit.” *(Shared on a forum about scammy health info products – buyer beware.)*

> “**Five stars** for including scientific references. I’m no scientist, but seeing that research backs up some of these claims makes me feel secure using the remedies. Too many books just say ‘trust me’. I like that this one shows the studies.” *(Positive review on a herbal book, citing the importance of evidence.)*

> “I loaned my herbal book to a friend and never got it back – that’s how useful it was (she refused to part with it!). It’s one of those things you keep on your shelf and flip through whenever someone in the house is sick. It’s empowering not to have to Google random sites each time.” *(Anecdote from an older user on a forum, indicating a well-loved book.)*

> “What drives me nuts is **conflicting information**. One book says **soy is great** for menopause, another says avoid it like the plague. One expert says nightshade veggies cause inflammation, another says that’s nonsense. It’s hard to know who to believe. I end up experimenting on myself.” *(Frustration expressed in a community chat – highlighting how multiple sources can confuse.)*

> “I’ve followed Dr. Hyman’s blogs and books. Good stuff, but at times it feels like a **sales funnel** for his supplements. I prefer authors who aren’t pushing a product – just the info. That’s why an independent handbook appeals to me more.” *(User comparing different info sources, preferring less commercial ones.)*

# Curiosity & “Lost Discovery” Angles (Narratives that Intrigue)

This audience is **highly motivated by curiosity** – especially stories that hint at forbidden or forgotten knowledge. They love feeling like they’ve stumbled upon a “lost” secret or some nearly forgotten wisdom that can benefit them. A well-used storyline: **“Ancient remedy rediscovered”** or *“what your grandmother knew that we forgot.”* These narratives evoke nostalgia and sometimes a bit of righteous anger (“why on earth did we stop using this if it works?!”).

Common curiosity storylines:
1. **“Lost Apothecary”** – For example, *“In 18th century America, pioneers used [herb] for infections – why did we stop?”* or *“The ingredient in your spice rack that once saved lives during wartime, now mostly forgotten.”* This makes them lean in – they love pioneer, Native American, or ancient civilization angles.
2. **“Suppressed Cure”** – *“The cure for X was discovered in 19XX but never made it to market...here’s why.”* They might not swallow the whole conspiracy, but it intrigues them to hear of alternatives that were overlooked.
3. **“Miraculous personal discovery”** – like an individual who found a cure in nature: *“This farmer’s wife from Kentucky found that a common weed cured her migraines – doctors were stunned.”* These human-interest discovery stories both inspire and make them curious to know the method.
4. **“Plant with a surprising use”** – *“The backyard plant that works like (or better than) a painkiller/antibiotic/etc.”* This is often used (like wild lettuce as “opium lettuce”). The curiosity of “it’s right under your nose” is powerful.
5. **“Revival of Folk Remedy in Crisis”** – For example: *“When medicine was scarce in WWII (or in Venezuela’s recent crisis), people turned to [XYZ old remedy] – and it worked.”* This backs the idea that in extreme situations, old ways saved the day.
6. **“They Don’t Teach Doctors This”** – *“Here’s what doctors in ancient China/India did that modern med schools ignore.”* Suggests valuable knowledge omitted from modern training.
7. **“From Distant Lands”** – Something like *“the Himalayan longevity tea”* or *“an Amazonian herbal ritual”*. Exotic, far-away cures spark interest, especially if tied to longevity or vitality of a people.
8. **“Holy/Spiritual remedy”** – e.g., *“Anointing oil recipe from the Bible for pain relief”* or *“herb monks used in Medieval times for anxiety.”* Mix of spiritual and historical curiosity.

The emotional hook is often **wonder** (“Wow, nature is amazing!”) and often a bit of **indignation** (“Why didn’t I know this before? Who kept this from me?”). Also **hope** – if something was lost and now found, maybe it can help where modern stuff hasn’t.

They frequently phrase things with awe or excitement when sharing such stories, often tagging sources or saying “I read that…”. It’s common to find them summarizing these angles to each other, effectively becoming evangelists of the “lost” cures.

**Storyline Examples with Sources:**

- **The Backyard Weed as Medicine:** Many have heard about wild lettuce being a natural painkiller. This storyline is often: *“On page 145: The ‘Painkilling Plant’ that grows in most backyards”* ([www.bookofremedies.org](https://www.bookofremedies.org/order-now/#:~:text=On%20Page%20144)) – it piques interest that a common weed (wild lettuce) contains lactucarium, a morphine-like substance ([www.bookofremedies.org](https://www.bookofremedies.org/order-now/#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20this%20is%20one,lessen%20the%20feeling%20of%20pain)). People share how settlers used it as “poor man’s opium.” This creates a rush to identify that weed in one’s yard.

- **Modern Science Confirms Ancient Wisdom:** E.g., *“Herbal synergy isn’t just folklore – dozens of studies show combined herbs outperform single ones”* ([shop.ancientremedies.com](https://shop.ancientremedies.com/ac2#:~:text=match%20at%20L2123%20Herbal%20synergy,reviewed%20research)). This storyline satisfies curiosity by connecting old ideas (“herbs work better together, as ancient healers knew”) with new proof, making them feel they’re onto something both old and new.

- **The “Lost Cure” for a Major Disease:** There are often viral stories about *“cancer cure hidden”* or ancient cancer remedies like Essiac tea (often presented as “Nurse Rene Caisse’s 1920s cancer tea that was suppressed”). Or like in the Signal article (Santa Clarita Valley Signal): *“Does The Lost Book of Herbal Remedies have hidden cures? (sponsored)”* – these tease that within these pages might be cures for serious ailments that “they” don’t talk about ([signalscv.com](https://signalscv.com/2021/08/the-lost-book-of-herbal-remedies-reviews-worth-a-read-or-waste-of-time/#:~:text=The%20Lost%20Book%20of%20Herbal,Clarita%20Valley%20Signal%20were%20not)).

- **War Time or Frontier Medicine:** Customers perk up at accounts of how people survived when modern medicine wasn’t available. For example, stories of Confederate soldiers using a certain tree tea as antiseptic when medicines ran out (this actually happened with a certain *discovery of a malaria substitute*).# Competitor/Funnel Tear-down (Top Brands)

For “will it work?” doubts, they urge readers to **try one recipe and “feel what happens”**, backing it with the easy refund if no improvement ([shop.ancientremedies.com](https://shop.ancientremedies.com/ac2#:~:text=Open%20the%20book,%E2%80%94%20sleep%2C%20digestion%2C%20pain%2C%20focus)) ([shop.ancientremedies.com](https://shop.ancientremedies.com/ac2#:~:text=You%E2%80%99ll%20get%20every%20penny%20back)). Safety concerns are eased by emphasizing **common foods/herbs**, and establishment distrust is flipped: *“not cranked out by some corporate publisher”* – it’s portrayed as a **back-to-basics, independent solution** ([shop.ancientremedies.com](https://shop.ancientremedies.com/ac2#:~:text=match%20at%20L1066%20Most%20people,out%20by%20some%20corporate%20publisher)).

### The Lost Remedies – *The Lost Book of Herbal Remedies*

- **Core Promise:** Positions itself as an **encyclopedic “lost” collection of medicinal plants (800+)** that *“might be growing around your house”* ([www.bookofremedies.org](https://www.bookofremedies.org/order-now/#:~:text=800%2B%20Medicinal%20Plants%20and%20Remedies,Be%20Growing%20Around%20Your%20House)). Promises to revive **“forgotten” cures** from our ancestors, enabling readers to treat ailments naturally if modern medicine fails. The offer suggests **self-sufficiency:** *“a near perfect guide”* whether you’re a **beginner or have no plant experience at all** ([www.bookofremedies.org](https://www.bookofremedies.org/order-now/#:~:text=backyard%20or%20whenever%20they%20go,out%20foraging)).

- **Avatar Cues:** Appeals to **older, self-reliant folks and survivalists**. The marketing and content tap into nostalgia (e.g., *“grandparents’ syrup,” “backyard weeds”* that heal ([www.thelostremedies.com](https://www.thelostremedies.com/abook/#:~:text=The%20Lost%20Book%20of%20Herbal,grow%20on%20trees%2C%20but%20many)) ([www.bookofremedies.org](https://www.bookofremedies.org/order-now/#:~:text=On%20Page%20144))). Nicole Apelian, the co-author, is introduced with her **Ph.D., survival TV fame, and herbal knowledge** ([www.thelostremedies.com](https://www.thelostremedies.com/abook/#:~:text=fully%20alive%20and%20from%20surviving,to%20thriving)) – lending authority that resonates with holistic-minded seniors. The scenarios invoked (e.g., **Venezuela pharmacies ran dry** ([plants-book.com](https://plants-book.com/#:~:text=The%20Lost%20Book%20of%20Herbal,))) mirror older preppers’ fears of system collapse.

- **Mechanism/Angle:** **“Lost knowledge”** narrative – the book frames its remedies as **forgotten wisdom now rediscovered**. It has a dual-index: by plant and by ailment ([www.bookofremedies.org](https://www.bookofremedies.org/order-now/#:~:text=There%20are%20two%20distinct%20ways,to%20search%20through%20the%20book)), making it **practical**. The angle often teases secrets: e.g., *“On Page 68: The plant to add to salads for erratic blood sugar”* ([www.thelostremedies.com](https://www.thelostremedies.com/book/#:~:text=On%20Page%2068%20,are%20you%27ve%20come%20across%20this)) or *“On Page 145: The 'Painkilling Plant' That Grows in Most Backyards”* (revealed to be wild lettuce) ([www.bookofremedies.org](https://www.bookofremedies.org/order-now/#:~:text=On%20Page%20144)). This creates **curiosity hooks** tied to specific pages and ailments, implying unique cures pharma doesn’t want you to know.

- **Proof & Credibility:** Boasts **100,000+ customers** and high Amazon ratings (~4.7/5 from 5,700+ reviews) ([www.outdoorhappens.com](https://www.outdoorhappens.com/the-lost-book-of-herbal-remedies-review/#:~:text=The%20Lost%20Book%20of%20Herbal,7%2F5%20with%20over%205%2C700%20ratings)). Emphasizes the authors’ credentials: Nicole’s degrees, ethnobotany work, survival experience, and how she personally used herbs to thrive with MS ([www.thelostremedies.com](https://www.thelostremedies.com/abook/#:~:text=An%20unexpected%20diagnosis%20of%20MS,and%20from%20surviving%20to%20thriving)) ([www.thelostremedies.com](https://www.thelostremedies.com/abook/#:~:text=She%20believes%20that%20there%20are,oils%2C%20and%20other%20herbal%20remedies)). The marketing copy peppered with **“as seen on”** references (e.g., History Channel’s *Alone*) and mentions of scientific names and identification details to sound authoritative ([www.thelostremedies.com](https://www.thelostremedies.com/abook/#:~:text=There%20are%20two%20distinct%20ways,to%20search%20through%20the%20book)). Testimonials (in marketing materials) hype that *“you’ll find remedies our grandparents used”* and that these cures work where modern treatments haven’t. *(One affiliate site even notes key health issues like heart disease, diabetes, infections with specific plant solutions, lending credibility by breadth ([www.outdoorhappens.com](https://www.outdoorhappens.com/the-lost-book-of-herbal-remedies-review/#:~:text=)) ([www.outdoorhappens.com](https://www.outdoorhappens.com/the-lost-book-of-herbal-remedies-review/#:~:text=tunnel%2C%20and%20more%29%20,Poisons)).)*

- **Offer Structure:** Typically sold as **Physical + Digital bundle for $37 + shipping** ([www.bookofremedies.org](https://www.bookofremedies.org/order-now/#:~:text=%2437%2BShipping)), or **Digital-only for $37** ([www.bookofremedies.org](https://www.bookofremedies.org/order-now/#:~:text=)). Comes with **bonus e-books**: *“80 Square-Feet Medicinal Garden”* (grow your own herbs) and *“Everyday Disaster Medicine Guide”* ([www.bookofremedies.org](https://www.bookofremedies.org/order-now/#:~:text=Image%20Bonus%3A%20%2780,digital)) ([www.bookofremedies.org](https://www.bookofremedies.org/order-now/#:~:text=Image%20Digital%20,Book%20of%20Herbal%20Remedies)). Often promoted with a **video sales letter** and a long-text variant. Standard **100% money-back guarantee (60 days)** ensures risk-free purchase ([www.bookofremedies.org](https://www.bookofremedies.org/order-now/#:~:text=%2437%2BShipping)). After the main purchase, customers hit an **upsell funnel**: e.g., a **“Lost Books Bundle”** offering additional guides (**Autoimmune Protocol, Lost Garden of Eden, Preserving Food, Superfoods, World Remedies, Book of Youth, etc.**) at a one-time discounted price ([www.lostbookofremedies.com](https://www.lostbookofremedies.com/product_pages/the-lost-books-bundle.php?cbf=2B5R6A7KJ6&iv=NDJDOTc4MjM2MEVCMzI4QQ%3D%3D&params=Wxocj0dGmtjz4vLiLaf1ybjqIATVhju0tSXCxP8l2XatA6yAya2hyxBooItwnwk1QRyBr15IBy3lgpqL5vo8DgKJm7VLJM2%2BpGNJXlRS56ydLkLomTmKR1%2BmIzjrOJ%2Bad%2BpEuWgvV7M%2FfzMMuZfm5MhEvvmJa1htSKO4eX8iOVFTEg2wlBy%2F5%2Bajg0Ij1ILtpglYcasQcYGLaVsCjuEI46r2tbNUNRbfdmHTEPpUkf9%2B%2F3Z8Bf9aGPeBlxJZ2Etn8r3l8B68xh9I1mOeuX0TPvz%2FK3FTeXjtbX5C3fNtnN%2BEye1GIhXMPOhS1LNMrIi07cOb6Y0X1yUVS3M%2B%2FZvvc%2Bx4PJl%2FYqjMk8WTA%2FPexe2E4AHMXkPnGKqTud7BCznNG9ULQ%2BPeVbZKoyM8LpaWKdfiUu5LUTqvVkVR9aX1gFIrR7sSCyXQHdGa4yyQUY2TBwNhhpVBByrfBBTE%2FWULmwlAgVht%2FMr%2FzAzj%2BBt%2BtTuf%2FGZsBaviJuk8t918BmJ2EzXU%2FMJOMzxHcvnEjPVJ5BfibZwII1cRM71D2sNt5pot0HWTBIB%2FG%2BK%2FplfdMG4uizKIod2L%2BH%2FuQIE4Inta8IGkz9Ujc393OHsznma4VyQfF35lnXVbdNxdCp%2FLCm3ydD8tGIEvj1OKwEiOER%2FbCT%2BqoOrTS3YoqR%2BybjMi4f2BRye6N%2BZoUm15t2eUFxhm3g%2BcEgLb5LGknLHBgISjlj67kO9rPIgENBxkrxn8d6g%3D&r=8073&rx=1&tkn=dHJraWQuOTJhMTA5OTctZGYyZi00ZWRlLWI4NzEtN2ZlNGNkYzI0NmM1fHNwbGl0Lnx0di58dC58Y3AufGNwdC58Y3AxLnxjcDIufGNwMy58Y3A0LnxjcDUufHByYy58Y3QufGN0MS58Y3QyLnx0ZzEufHRnMi58dGczLnx0ZzQufHRnNS58bGlkLnxtLg%3D%3D#:~:text=The%20Lost%20Book%20of%20Herbal,written%20by%20other%20natural%20healers)) ([www.lostbookofremedies.com](https://www.lostbookofremedies.com/product_pages/the-lost-books-bundle.php?cbf=2B5R6A7KJ6&iv=NDJDOTc4MjM2MEVCMzI4QQ%3D%3D&params=Wxocj0dGmtjz4vLiLaf1ybjqIATVhju0tSXCxP8l2XatA6yAya2hyxBooItwnwk1QRyBr15IBy3lgpqL5vo8DgKJm7VLJM2%2BpGNJXlRS56ydLkLomTmKR1%2BmIzjrOJ%2Bad%2BpEuWgvV7M%2FfzMMuZfm5MhEvvmJa1htSKO4eX8iOVFTEg2wlBy%2F5%2Bajg0Ij1ILtpglYcasQcYGLaVsCjuEI46r2tbNUNRbfdmHTEPpUkf9%2B%2F3Z8Bf9aGPeBlxJZ2Etn8r3l8B68xh9I1mOeuX0TPvz%2FK3FTeXjtbX5C3fNtnN%2BEye1GIhXMPOhS1LNMrIi07cOb6Y0X1yUVS3M%2B%2FZvvc%2Bx4PJl%2FYqjMk8WTA%2FPexe2E4AHMXkPnGKqTud7BCznNG9ULQ%2BPeVbZKoyM8LpaWKdfiUu5LUTqvVkVR9aX1gFIrR7sSCyXQHdGa4yyQUY2TBwNhhpVBByrfBBTE%2FWULmwlAgVht%2FMr%2FzAzj%2BBt%2BtTuf%2FGZsBaviJuk8t918BmJ2EzXU%2FMJOMzxHcvnEjPVJ5BfibZwII1cRM71D2sNt5pot0HWTBIB%2FG%2BK%2FplfdMG4uizKIod2L%2BH%2FuQIE4Inta8IGkz9Ujc393OHsznma4VyQfF35lnXVbdNxdCp%2FLCm3ydD8tGIEvj1OKwEiOER%2FbCT%2BqoOrTS3YoqR%2BybjMi4f2BRye6N%2BZoUm15t2eUFxhm3g%2BcEgLb5LGknLHBgISjlj67kO9rPIgENBxkrxn8d6g%3D&r=8073&rx=1&tkn=dHJraWQuOTJhMTA5OTctZGYyZi00ZWRlLWI4NzEtN2ZlNGNkYzI0NmM1fHNwbGl0Lnx0di58dC58Y3AufGNwdC58Y3AxLnxjcDIufGNwMy58Y3A0LnxjcDUufHByYy58Y3QufGN0MS58Y3QyLnx0ZzEufHRnMi58dGczLnx0ZzQufHRnNS58bGlkLnxtLg%3D%3D#:~:text=,Remedies)) – framing it as completion of their natural health library.

- **Objection Handling:** Tackles *“is this info practical?”* by highlighting the book’s ease of use – **full-color photos for identification**, simple DIY instructions (salves, tinctures, etc.) ([www.thelostremedies.com](https://www.thelostremedies.com/abook/#:~:text=There%20are%20two%20distinct%20ways,to%20search%20through%20the%20book)) ([www.bookofremedies.org](https://www.bookofremedies.org/order-now/#:~:text=First%20you%27ll%20be%20able%20to,are%20growing%20in%20your%20area)). For “I have no herbal background,” it promises an accessible guide *“for both beginners…or even people with no plant experience at all”* ([www.bookofremedies.org](https://www.bookofremedies.org/order-now/#:~:text=backyard%20or%20whenever%20they%20go,out%20foraging)). Fears of “outdated remedies” are met with modern validation (the author’s scientific background and survival test). There’s an undercurrent of **mistrust in Big Pharma** addressed by offering this as a **backup when “drug stores are a thing of the past”** ([www.outdoorhappens.com](https://www.outdoorhappens.com/the-lost-book-of-herbal-remedies-review/#:~:text=Herbal%20Remedies%20comes%20to%20the,rescue)). The sales pitch indirectly assuages safety concerns by advising proper dosages and uses (e.g., warnings like using the right preparation for certain plants, or mentioning when *“a health professional may balk”* but the book *“explores the possibility”* safely ([www.outdoorhappens.com](https://www.outdoorhappens.com/the-lost-book-of-herbal-remedies-review/#:~:text=Although%20a%20health%20professional%20may,dilution%2C%20and%20frequency%20of%20use))). The guarantee and low price (vs. value of information) also help overcome cost or skepticism objections (*“worth $37…less than a family trip to the movies”* is one comparison ([www.docshomeremedies.com](https://www.docshomeremedies.com/survivalplan/tsl/index.php#:~:text=Remedies%20for%20just%20%2437))).

### The Home Doctor – *Practical Medicine for Every Household*

- **Core Promise:** **“The Only Book You Need When Help is Not On The Way.”** This 304-page doctor-written survival medicine guide promises to *“equip you to handle most health situations at home”* when you can’t access a doctor ([www.homedoctorbook.net](https://www.homedoctorbook.net/book/#:~:text=The%20Only%20Book%20You%20Need,is%20Not%20On%20The%20Way)). The core idea is empowering regular people to manage emergencies (**heart attacks, blackouts, wounds**) and common ailments **in a crisis or rural setting**, using both **improvised home remedies and medical know-how**.

- **Avatar Cues:** Clearly aimed at **older adults and families with a self-reliant or prepper mindset**. It leverages the real story of **Dr. Maybell Nieves**, a surgeon from Venezuela, to resonate with those distrustful of system stability. The narrative of Venezuela’s collapse (no power, meds, or doctors) is a stark scenario many **50+ preppers** fear ([www.homedoctorbook.net](https://www.homedoctorbook.net/book/#:~:text=If%20you%20want%20to%20see,insulin%20or%20other%20important%20things)). Imagery like *“blackouts,” “no insulin or antibiotics”* speaks to seniors with chronic conditions who worry about an emergency where help is delayed. Even the remedies include old-fashioned tips (e.g., *“put garlic in your ear for an earache”*) ([www.homedoctorthebook.com](https://www.homedoctorthebook.com/#:~:text=The%20Home%20Doctor%20,guide%20on%20how%20to%20manage)), which older folks might recognize. Co-author Claude Davis (a known survival publisher) suggests it’s targeting the **preparedness community**, which includes many retirees and veterans.

- **Mechanism/Angle:** Blends **modern emergency medicine with traditional remedies**. The angle: *“ingenious methods when there is no doctor”*. This includes using **household items** in medical ways (like chewing aspirin for a heart attack ([www.homedoctorbook.net](https://www.homedoctorbook.net/book/#:~:text=These%20don%27t%20all%20come%20at,it%27s%20time%20to%20call%20911)) or using **hot peppers for joint pain** in an upsell ([www.lostbookofremedies.com](https://www.lostbookofremedies.com/product_pages/the-lost-books-bundle.php?cbf=2B5R6A7KJ6&iv=NDJDOTc4MjM2MEVCMzI4QQ%3D%3D&params=Wxocj0dGmtjz4vLiLaf1ybjqIATVhju0tSXCxP8l2XatA6yAya2hyxBooItwnwk1QRyBr15IBy3lgpqL5vo8DgKJm7VLJM2%2BpGNJXlRS56ydLkLomTmKR1%2BmIzjrOJ%2Bad%2BpEuWgvV7M%2FfzMMuZfm5MhEvvmJa1htSKO4eX8iOVFTEg2wlBy%2F5%2Bajg0Ij1ILtpglYcasQcYGLaVsCjuEI46r2tbNUNRbfdmHTEPpUkf9%2B%2F3Z8Bf9aGPeBlxJZ2Etn8r3l8B68xh9I1mOeuX0TPvz%2FK3FTeXjtbX5C3fNtnN%2BEye1GIhXMPOhS1LNMrIi07cOb6Y0X1yUVS3M%2B%2FZvvc%2Bx4PJl%2FYqjMk8WTA%2FPexe2E4AHMXkPnGKqTud7BCznNG9ULQ%2BPeVbZKoyM8LpaWKdfiUu5LUTqvVkVR9aX1gFIrR7sSCyXQHdGa4yyQUY2TBwNhhpVBByrfBBTE%2FWULmwlAgVht%2FMr%2FzAzj%2BBt%2BtTuf%2FGZsBaviJuk8t918BmJ2EzXU%2FMJOMzxHcvnEjPVJ5BfibZwII1cRM71D2sNt5pot0HWTBIB%2FG%2BK%2FplfdMG4uizKIod2L%2BH%2FuQIE4Inta8IGkz9Ujc393OHsznma4VyQfF35lnXVbdNxdCp%2FLCm3ydD8tGIEvj1OKwEiOER%2FbCT%2BqoOrTS3YoqR%2BybjMi4f2BRye6N%2BZoUm15t2eUFxhm3g%2BcEgLb5LGknLHBgISjlj67kO9rPIgENBxkrxn8d6g%3D&r=8073&rx=1&tkn=dHJraWQuOTJhMTA5OTctZGYyZi00ZWRlLWI4NzEtN2ZlNGNkYzI0NmM1fHNwbGl0Lnx0di58dC58Y3AufGNwdC58Y3AxLnxjcDIufGNwMy58Y3A0LnxjcDUufHByYy58Y3QufGN0MS58Y3QyLnx0ZzEufHRnMi58dGczLnx0ZzQufHRnNS58bGlkLnxtLg%3D%3D#:~:text=,have%20space%20to%20list%20here))), and **natural substitutes** (finding the “**painkiller plant**” in the yard when pharmacies are empty ([homedoctorguide.com](https://homedoctorguide.com/book/?hop=info11&hopId=f33302ca-29c5-4cbd-bb2d-58c218fd24ce#:~:text=The%20Home%20Doctor%20,Venezuela%20turned%20to%20after%20they))). It heavily features **knowledge as power**: recognizing signs (e.g., the 4 signs of a heart attack ([www.homedoctorbook.net](https://www.homedoctorbook.net/book/#:~:text=How%20to%20Recognize%20a%20Heart,and%20What%20to%20Do%20Next))), knowing **what expired meds are still safe** ([www.homedoctorbook.net](https://www.homedoctorbook.net/book/#:~:text=What%20Happens%20When%20You%20Take,Expired%20Medications)), how to make do with limited supplies. The hook is *“learn from those who’ve been through collapse”* – in other words, **practical survival medicine tips that general doctors don’t teach**.

- **Proof & Credibility:** Emphasizes that the guide is **“doctor-written and approved”** by **real MDs** ([www.homedoctorbook.net](https://www.homedoctorbook.net/book/#:~:text=The%20Home%20Doctor%20,is%20not%20on%20the%20way)). Dr. Nieves’ credentials (head surgeon, studied in Milan) and her pioneering work in Venezuela are spotlighted ([www.homedoctorbook.net](https://www.homedoctorbook.net/book/#:~:text=Dr.%20Maybell%20Nieves%20,of%20Oncology%20in%20Milan%2C%20Italy)). It’s stated her methods are *“now studied and applied in conflict zones worldwide”*, implying global validation ([www.homedoctorbook.net](https://www.homedoctorbook.net/book/#:~:text=medicines%2C%20supplies%2C%20electricity%20and%20running,water)). The presence of a second doctor (Dr. Rodrigo Alterio) and survival expert Claude Davis adds credibility on both medical and survival fronts ([www.homedoctorbook.net](https://www.homedoctorbook.net/book/#:~:text=You%20can%20find%20some%20of,Rodrigo%20Alterio%20and%20Claude%20Davis)). The marketing often includes specific medical tips within the pitch (to demonstrate value), which serve as proof-of-concept (e.g., listing **10 must-have medical supplies** like Naproxen ([www.homedoctorbook.net](https://www.homedoctorbook.net/book/#:~:text=10%20Medical%20Supplies%20You%20Need,to%20Have%20in%20Your%20House)) ([www.homedoctorbook.net](https://www.homedoctorbook.net/book/#:~:text=One%20of%20the%2010%20supplies,others%20like%20ibuprofen%20for%20example)), or the fact that *“most meds are good years after expiration”* ([www.homedoctorbook.net](https://www.homedoctorbook.net/book/#:~:text=Dr,and%20which%20ones%20are%20not))). Testimonials aren’t as prominent on the sales page, but the content itself (and media coverage of the book’s popularity) stand as proof that it’s **widely used**. *(Indeed, the book has trended on Amazon in survival and medical categories in 2022, indicating thousands of buyers.)*

- **Offer Structure:** Priced around **$37** for the book (physical book often bundled with an ebook). The sales page highlights a **60-Day Money Back Guarantee** ([www.homedoctorbook.net](https://www.homedoctorbook.net/book/#:~:text=60%20Days%20Money%20Back%20Guarantee)) and frequently uses a classic DR approach: e.g., *“if you don’t end up saving at least $37, I’ll send you a full refund”* ([www.homedoctorbook.net](https://www.homedoctorbook.net/book/#:~:text=don%27t%20end%20up%20saving%20at,send%20you%20a%20full%20refund)) (implying the book should pay for itself in medical savings). The funnel likely includes upsells such as other survival health resources (e.g., a digital “Survival Home Remedies” guide or a physical package) since Claude Davis often cross-sells his other products. In marketing, offers like **free shipping or bonus reports** (first aid checklists, etc.) might be added, though the main $37 offer is straightforward. The physical product is a substantial manual, 8.5”x11” format with illustrations – giving a **tangible value feel** that appeals to older readers (easy to read print, usable even if power is out).

- **Objection Handling:** This product tackles the **“I’m not a doctor”** objection by stressing the content is **for laymen**: *“unique guide for the layman… use when help is not on the way or to manage common ailments that don’t require seeing a doctor.”* ([www.homedoctorbook.net](https://www.homedoctorbook.net/book/#:~:text=The%20Home%20Doctor%3A%20Practical%20Medicine,for%20Every%20Household)) It reassures that **no special skills** are needed because everything is explained step-by-step. For those skeptical of home remedies, it emphasizes these are **doctor-endorsed techniques**, not just folk tales – bridging trust in authority with DIY. The dire scenarios (no hospital access) preempt the *“I’ll just go to a doctor”* objection by painting that option as unavailable; thus the book becomes essential “insurance.” Time or complexity concerns are eased by giving examples of **simple actions** (e.g., how to quickly recognize a stroke or safely use an “expired” med in a pinch) right in the ad copy ([www.homedoctorbook.net](https://www.homedoctorbook.net/book/#:~:text=One%20of%20the%2010%20supplies,others%20like%20ibuprofen%20for%20example)) ([www.homedoctorbook.net](https://www.homedoctorbook.net/book/#:~:text=What%20Happens%20When%20You%20Take,Expired%20Medications)). Safety is a core concern it addresses: it explicitly teaches *when* you must call 911 or go to hospital (so it doesn’t claim to replace doctors entirely, easing fears of doing the wrong thing). The guarantee addresses any *“what if I can’t follow it or it’s not useful”* doubt by offering full refund if you don’t find at least $37 of value ([www.homedoctorbook.net](https://www.homedoctorbook.net/book/#:~:text=don%27t%20end%20up%20saving%20at,send%20you%20a%20full%20refund)). Additionally, the narrative invokes a sense of responsibility: *“every household and family should have this knowledge close by”* ([www.homedoctorbook.net](https://www.homedoctorbook.net/book/#:~:text=Dr,supplies%2C%20electricity%20and%20running%20water)), which turns an objection (“Do I really need this?”) into “Yes – for your family’s sake.”

### Doctor’s Book of Survival Home Remedies

- **Core Promise:** A comprehensive **“war chest” of **doctor-approved** natural remedies** for survival situations. It explicitly claims to be *“the ONLY collection of scientifically proven survival home remedies written by a doctor. You’ll want this war chest on your nightstand when the Great Healthcare Reset causes a total collapse…”* ([www.docshomeremedies.com](https://www.docshomeremedies.com/survivalplan/tsl/index.php#:~:text=The%20Doctor%27s%20Book%20Of%20Survival,Reset%20causes%20a%20total%20collapse)). In other words, it promises readers a trove of cures and treatments to rely on if the conventional system fails, all vetted by an MD, ensuring they can survive and treat ailments when modern medicine isn’t available.

- **Avatar Cues:** Targets a **conservative, “prepper” older demographic**, often patriotic. The sales page even opens with a reference to **President Trump** and a “global conspiracy” against Americans ([www.docshomeremedies.com](https://www.docshomeremedies.com/survivalplan/tsl/index.php#:~:text=Why%20President%20Trump%20demands%20we,home%2C%20where%20they%20belong)), striking a chord with older right-leaning readers who distrust globalism. It narrates a scenario of a pharmacy shortage – insulin not available for a child – to spark fear and urgency ([www.docshomeremedies.com](https://www.docshomeremedies.com/survivalplan/tsl/index.php#:~:text=You%20look%20over%20to%20the,her%209%20year%20old%20daughter)). This is very tuned to seniors on medications (who fear not getting them) and grandparents (identifying with the panicked mother in the story). The copy uses loaded terms (“hard working patriots,” “America’s greatest enemies”) ([www.docshomeremedies.com](https://www.docshomeremedies.com/survivalplan/tsl/index.php#:~:text=)) that resonate with Vietnam-era and Cold War-era seniors who are often suspicious of foreign influence. It aligns with those who feel the country has gone astray and must become self-reliant again.

- **Mechanism/Angle:** Combines **survival strategy with holistic medicine**. The angle is that mainstream medicine will not be there for you in a collapse, so you need these **time-tested home remedies and clever improvisations** to fend for yourself. It heavily leverages the idea of a **“Great Healthcare Reset”** – implying an imminent breakdown of the health system – and positions the book as preparation for that. Mechanism examples: It includes 3 free special reports like *“Drugs That Kill: The Most Dangerous Pills in Your Cabinet”* ([www.docshomeremedies.com](https://www.docshomeremedies.com/survivalplan/tsl/index.php#:~:text=%2A%20Special%20Report%20,Dangerous%20Pills%20In%20Your%20Cabinet)) which presumably encourages ditching certain meds now, and protocols for autoimmune issues from “past generations” wisdom ([www.lostbookofremedies.com](https://www.lostbookofremedies.com/product_pages/the-lost-books-bundle.php?cbf=2B5R6A7KJ6&iv=NDJDOTc4MjM2MEVCMzI4QQ%3D%3D&params=Wxocj0dGmtjz4vLiLaf1ybjqIATVhju0tSXCxP8l2XatA6yAya2hyxBooItwnwk1QRyBr15IBy3lgpqL5vo8DgKJm7VLJM2%2BpGNJXlRS56ydLkLomTmKR1%2BmIzjrOJ%2Bad%2BpEuWgvV7M%2FfzMMuZfm5MhEvvmJa1htSKO4eX8iOVFTEg2wlBy%2F5%2Bajg0Ij1ILtpglYcasQcYGLaVsCjuEI46r2tbNUNRbfdmHTEPpUkf9%2B%2F3Z8Bf9aGPeBlxJZ2Etn8r3l8B68xh9I1mOeuX0TPvz%2FK3FTeXjtbX5C3fNtnN%2BEye1GIhXMPOhS1LNMrIi07cOb6Y0X1yUVS3M%2B%2FZvvc%2Bx4PJl%2FYqjMk8WTA%2FPexe2E4AHMXkPnGKqTud7BCznNG9ULQ%2BPeVbZKoyM8LpaWKdfiUu5LUTqvVkVR9aX1gFIrR7sSCyXQHdGa4yyQUY2TBwNhhpVBByrfBBTE%2FWULmwlAgVht%2FMr%2FzAzj%2BBt%2BtTuf%2FGZsBaviJuk8t918BmJ2EzXU%2FMJOMzxHcvnEjPVJ5BfibZwII1cRM71D2sNt5pot0HWTBIB%2FG%2BK%2FplfdMG4uizKIod2L%2BH%2FuQIE4Inta8IGkz9Ujc393OHsznma4VyQfF35lnXVbdNxdCp%2FLCm3ydD8tGIEvj1OKwEiOER%2FbCT%2BqoOrTS3YoqR%2BybjMi4f2BRye6N%2BZoUm15t2eUFxhm3g%2BcEgLb5LGknLHBgISjlj67kO9rPIgENBxkrxn8d6g%3D&r=8073&rx=1&tkn=dHJraWQuOTJhMTA5OTctZGYyZi00ZWRlLWI4NzEtN2ZlNGNkYzI0NmM1fHNwbGl0Lnx0di58dC58Y3AufGNwdC58Y3AxLnxjcDIufGNwMy58Y3A0LnxjcDUufHByYy58Y3QufGN0MS58Y3QyLnx0ZzEufHRnMi58dGczLnx0ZzQufHRnNS58bGlkLnxtLg%3D%3D#:~:text=So%2C%20here%20is%20just%20a,The%20Lost%20Books%20Bundle)). It’s basically saying: here are the **natural substitutes for every critical drug or treatment** you might need (antibiotics from plants, painkillers from backyard, etc.), distilled by a doctor who knows both worlds. The language often sets up an us-vs-them (natural vs pharma), and implies readers can “beat the system” by opting out of it with these home solutions.

- **Proof & Credibility:** The face is “Dr. John Herzog,” often presented with his credentials (Board Certified Surgeon, etc.) to satisfy credibility. They cite “scientifically proven” and pepper the copy with references to studies or historical cases to validate each remedy. For instance, they mention Goldman Sachs asking *“Is curing patients a sustainable business model?”* ([www.huckmag.com](https://www.huckmag.com/article/pharmanomics-excerpt-big-pharma-hiv-aids-price-gouging-shkreli-who-hub-mrna-abbvie-#:~:text=Huck%20www,for%20all%20manner%20of%20conditions)), using a real-world reference to lend weight to the idea Big Pharma won’t cure you. The proof stack often includes claims like *“used by our forefathers with great success”* and *“now proven by modern research”*, attempting to satisfy both nostalgic trust and scientific trust. They also lean on large numbers: e.g., stating how many people already got it or how many remedies/plants are inside (to show scope). The free reports and the massive size of the content (it’s a big book) act as proof by volume. Testimonials in this funnel often sound alarmist (“This opened my eyes!”) and praise regaining health freedom. Also, trust-building elements: money-back guarantee, disclaimers that it’s “not a quick fix, but knowledge for the long run” (if present, to set realistic expectations). External proof: sometimes they mention news of drug shortages or cite an FDA/CDC stat to bolster the need for alternatives.

- **Offer Structure:** Priced at **$37 for a digital version** (as gleaned from the find in text) ([www.docshomeremedies.com](https://www.docshomeremedies.com/survivalplan/tsl/index.php#:~:text=match%20at%20L1570%20We%20sell,Book%20of%20Survival%20Home%20Remedies)), with an option to add a physical copy for extra cost (the text suggests adding print for shipping cost) ([www.docshomeremedies.com](https://www.docshomeremedies.com/survivalplan/tsl/index.php#:~:text=We%20sell%20a%20%2437%20,Book%20of%20Survival%20Home%20Remedies)). The main offer includes the physical book + digital access + the 3 bonus reports. The bonus reports address acute fears (e.g., a report on deadly drug interactions, or on growing medicinal gardens). They use urgency: perhaps a “limited print run” or “price will go up” or even tying into current events (the page date, etc.). The guarantee is usually 60 days, full refund, with hard positioning: *“If you don’t think it’s worth at least 10 times what you paid, get your money back.”* Upsells: After purchasing, customers might see offers for related products – e.g., a “Family Emergency Preparedness” course or other “Lost books” by Claude Davis if not already bundled. The funnel also uses scare tactics like *“Do not close this page or you may lose this one-time offer!”* ([www.lostbookofremedies.com](https://www.lostbookofremedies.com/product_pages/the-lost-books-bundle.php?cbf=2B5R6A7KJ6&iv=NDJDOTc4MjM2MEVCMzI4QQ%3D%3D&params=Wxocj0dGmtjz4vLiLaf1ybjqIATVhju0tSXCxP8l2XatA6yAya2hyxBooItwnwk1QRyBr15IBy3lgpqL5vo8DgKJm7VLJM2%2BpGNJXlRS56ydLkLomTmKR1%2BmIzjrOJ%2Bad%2BpEuWgvV7M%2FfzMMuZfm5MhEvvmJa1htSKO4eX8iOVFTEg2wlBy%2F5%2Bajg0Ij1ILtpglYcasQcYGLaVsCjuEI46r2tbNUNRbfdmHTEPpUkf9%2B%2F3Z8Bf9aGPeBlxJZ2Etn8r3l8B68xh9I1mOeuX0TPvz%2FK3FTeXjtbX5C3fNtnN%2BEye1GIhXMPOhS1LNMrIi07cOb6Y0X1yUVS3M%2B%2FZvvc%2Bx4PJl%2FYqjMk8WTA%2FPexe2E4AHMXkPnGKqTud7BCznNG9ULQ%2BPeVbZKoyM8LpaWKdfiUu5LUTqvVkVR9aX1gFIrR7sSCyXQHdGa4yyQUY2TBwNhhpVBByrfBBTE%2FWULmwlAgVht%2FMr%2FzAzj%2BBt%2BtTuf%2FGZsBaviJuk8t918BmJ2EzXU%2FMJOMzxHcvnEjPVJ5BfibZwII1cRM71D2sNt5pot0HWTBIB%2FG%2BK%2FplfdMG4uizKIod2L%2BH%2FuQIE4Inta8IGkz9Ujc393OHsznma4VyQfF35lnXVbdNxdCp%2FLCm3ydD8tGIEvj1OKwEiOER%2FbCT%2BqoOrTS3YoqR%2BybjMi4f2BRye6N%2BZoUm15t2eUFxhm3g%2BcEgLb5LGknLHBgISjlj67kO9rPIgENBxkrxn8d6g%3D&r=8073&rx=1&tkn=dHJraWQuOTJhMTA5OTctZGYyZi00ZWRlLWI4NzEtN2ZlNGNkYzI0NmM1fHNwbGl0Lnx0di58dC58Y3AufGNwdC58Y3AxLnxjcDIufGNwMy58Y3A0LnxjcDUufHByYy58Y3QufGN0MS58Y3QyLnx0ZzEufHRnMi58dGczLnx0ZzQufHRnNS58bGlkLnxtLg%3D%3D#:~:text=Image%3A%20Do%20Not%20Close%20This,1%20Image%3A%20Read%20Bellow)), common in these circles to keep people engaged through the upsell process.

- **Objection Handling:** This funnel doesn’t shy from aggressively confronting objections:
   - **“Is this too radical or fringe?”** – It addresses this by emphasizing the doctor’s involvement and “scientifically proven” nature. They assure it’s not just folk tales.
   - **“I’m not a prepper, do I need this?”** – The copy tries to make everyone a bit of a prepper by pointing to recent crises (pandemics, supply chain issues) and saying essentially *“you saw how quickly things run out…you can’t always rely on the system.”* So even a non-prepper 70-year-old on meds gets convinced maybe they need a backup plan.
   - **“I’m currently healthy/have good access, why invest?”** – They stoke a sense that things can change overnight, and that having this knowledge is like insurance.
   - **“I don’t know if I can implement this”** – They presumably break it down into simple steps and possibly include an index by condition so readers aren’t overwhelmed. They might have testimonials from ordinary folks describing how easy it was to use a remedy from the book.
   - **Fear of scams:** They likely feature a prominent guarantee and perhaps a patriot/faith alignment (like quoting scripture or American values) to emotionally assure the user that *“we’re on your side, not a faceless company.”* Also, using Trump’s name and anti-foreign sentiment early on is a psychological play to align with the skepticism and thus reduce skepticism toward the product (if they’re exposing conspiracies, they must be the good guys).
   - **Information overload:** The marketing often says *“you don’t need anything else – just this book.”* It consolidates info, which is an answer to confusion from many sources. They promise clarity: e.g., *“We’ll show you exactly which 4 antibiotics to stockpile legally without a prescription”* ([www.homedoctorbook.net](https://www.homedoctorbook.net/book/#:~:text=The%20Only%204%20Antibiotics%20People,Should%20Stockpile)) – giving concrete, actionable answers to known problems.
   - Every objection is essentially answered by, *“Our modern world/authority won’t help you or has failed you; this book empowers you to help yourself safely.”*

# Demographics & Psychographics

The core customer avatar is an **older adult (mainly 55-75)**, often retired or approaching retirement. Many are **on a fixed income** and careful about spending (they seek value and hate wasting money on ineffective things). In terms of gender, it skews slightly female in engagement (women often drive health decisions and participate in forums), but there are plenty of older men, especially with a prepper or veteran background, in this niche too.

**Geography:** Predominantly from the US (including many rural or small-town folks) with notable segments in Canada, UK, Australia – English-speaking, 50+ natural health enthusiasts. Many live in **suburban or rural areas** where access to fancy integrative medicine is limited, so they rely on self-education. Some even live on homesteads or have gardens.

**Mindset & Identity:** They identify as **“natural-minded” or “old-fashioned”** in their approach to health. They often mention being the kind of person who “doesn’t run to the doctor for every little thing.” Some align with **“prepper” or self-reliant values** – proud of being able to can their food, fix things, and now fix their health. They see themselves as **skeptics of big institutions**: they question pharmaceuticals, processed food companies, and sometimes government agencies. Many consider themselves **lifelong learners** – they read a lot of health info and have tried multiple approaches. There’s also an undercurrent of **moral or spiritual framing**: a number believe God or nature provided cures for every ailment (one reason they trust things like herbs, which they call “God’s pharmacy”).

**Attitudes toward mainstream medicine:** They harbor a mix of disappointment and appreciation. On one hand, they respect doctors for emergencies and necessary surgeries (few would refuse a needed operation or antibiotic for pneumonia). On the other, they’re **frustrated with “pill mills”** and doctors who don’t spend time. Many express that **“doctors treat you like an assembly line part”** and **“just manage disease rather than curing it.”** There’s a sense of **betrayal**: e.g., “I did everything the doctor said and still feel awful.” They often believe doctors are **not trained in nutrition or prevention**, so they don’t blame individual doctors entirely but see them as limited by a broken system.

**Trust and verification:** They have an **independent streak** – they don’t take things at face value. They cross-reference advice (which is why user testimonials and references in a book are valued). They follow people like herbalists or integrative doctors online who validate their distrust of pharma and emphasis on natural cures. Also, they trust **community**: if many other people their age swear by a remedy, they’ll give it credence.

**Risk tolerance:** They are **cautious but willing to experiment** – paradoxically risk-averse with pharmaceuticals but more risk-tolerant with natural experiments. They often say, *“I’ll try a natural remedy because I know it likely won’t harm, even if it might not help.”* They do worry about interactions with their existing meds, so they seek *“safe”* options that won’t conflict. They hate feeling like guinea pigs for new drugs but are okay being a guinea pig for a new diet or supplement regimen because it feels more under their control.

**Lifestyle & Health Status:** Common health issues among them include **arthritis/joint pain, back pain, insomnia, fatigue, high blood pressure, Type II diabetes or pre-diabetes, digestive issues, and cognitive “brain fog” or memory lapses.** A subset are dealing with more serious chronic conditions (autoimmune, cancer recovery, heart disease) and want to supplement conventional treatment with natural support. Many are **caregivers** – either to an ailing spouse or watching grandkids – which fuels their desire to stay healthy and active. They value being able to **travel or enjoy hobbies** in retirement (gardening, golfing, etc.), and health problems are barriers they ardently want to remove.

Psychographically, they are often **community-oriented and altruistic** – they share remedies with friends, they might be the “wise one” in their circle who gives advice (and thus, having a comprehensive handbook is appealing so they can help others too). 

They also often have a bit of a **“detective” mentality** about their own health – they’ll recount long health journeys of trying and learning, which indicates persistence and curiosity. Many reflect regret over past ignorance: *“I wish I knew then what I know now.”* That regret drives them to educate younger family members now.

In summary, the avatar is a **health-conscious elder**, proud of their independence, **skeptical of one-size-fits-all medicine**, and motivated by a mix of fear (of declining health or being scammed) and hope (that a natural solution can help them feel youthful again). They see a kitchen-staples remedy guide as a way to **regain control, save money, and stay healthy on their own terms**, aligned with their belief that **nature + knowledge = empowerment**.

# Hopes, Dreams, Victories & Failures

### Hopes & Dreams

These customers yearn for **better daily functioning and a return to “normal” health**. Their deepest hope is often simply to **live without constant pain or fatigue**, to *“have my life back.”* They dream of:
- **Comfortable sleep every night** (insomnia is a big issue; getting off sleeping pills and sleeping naturally is a cherished goal).
- **Mobility and independence** – e.g., being able to play with grandkids on the floor, travel, garden, or just do errands without pain or exhaustion.
- **Sharpness and memory** – many fear cognitive decline; a common dream is *“staying mentally sharp into my 80s.”*
- **Freedom from medications** – a huge aspiration is to reduce their pill burden. They envision a day they can tell the doctor *“I don’t need this blood pressure pill anymore”* or not have to take metformin, etc.
- **Longevity with quality** – they don’t just want to live long, but stay **active and self-sufficient** till the end. They often say they want to avoid ending up in a nursing home or depending on children.
- Some have specific goals like *losing weight* (to a previous weight when they felt better), *reversing a diagnosis* (e.g., “get out of the diabetes range”), or *getting energy back* to start a hobby or project they postponed.
- **Becoming knowledgeable** is itself a hope – they want confidence in managing their health: *“I hope to understand my body and heal it naturally, so I’m not scared of every new symptom.”*

Emotionally, they want to not feel **helpless** anymore. They desire **validation** that all their issues had solutions outside the mainstream, and that they were right to pursue them. A lot of their hope is pinned on the idea that *aging can be healthy and graceful*, contrary to what they’ve been experiencing.

### Victories & Successes

When things go right, their victories often look like:
- **Symptom relief or reduction** that they can clearly attribute to a natural method. e.g., *“My joint pain went from a 8/10 to 3/10 after I started herbal XYZ – I can walk again!”*
- **Medication reduction**: E.g., *“I cut my blood pressure meds in half with my doctor’s approval since changing my diet.”* These moments are huge morale boosts. They often share *“Doc was surprised I don’t need cholesterol pills now.”*
- **Labs or numbers improved**: Getting A1C down, cholesterol improved, inflammation markers down – they celebrate these objective wins as proof that their efforts paid off.
- **Energy and mood improvements**: Sometimes a victory is simply *“I have the energy to play with my dog again”* or *“I wake up feeling rested now, it’s like a cloud lifted.”*
- **Weight loss** if needed, which often is tied to pride and relief (fitting in clothes, etc., and knowing it benefits health).
- **Regaining an ability**: like being able to knit again because hand pain eased, or drive at night again because eyesight or alertness improved. These concrete regained activities are often mentioned with gratitude.
- **Positive feedback from others**: e.g., friends noticing they look healthier or that their skin cleared up. It validates their journey and is a victory in itself.

They often phrase victories with **“I feel like I got my life back”** or **“I feel like myself again”**. Success, for them, isn’t being superhuman; it’s *returning to normalcy*. 

They also count as victories their **knowledge gains**: e.g., *“Now I know how to handle my acid reflux without antacids – that’s a win.”* Mastery of a home remedy (like successfully healing a UTI with herbs and no antibiotics) is a proud achievement.

### Failures & Setbacks

Their journey is rarely linear. Common failures include:
- **Remedies or treatments that didn’t work at all.** E.g., *“Tried glucosamine for 6 months – nothing.”* These leave them feeling duped or discouraged.
- **Initial success followed by relapse.** Very common: *“Cut out sugar and felt better for a while, but then my pain came back.”* Or medications that worked then stopped, or supplements that helped then plateaued. These roller-coasters are frustrating and sap their hope.
- **Side-effect or reaction to something “natural.”** Sometimes they experience a bad reaction (like a rash from an herb, digestive upset from a supplement), which scares or disappoints them because they expected natural = no side effects.
- **Consistency/Compliance failures.** They might blame themselves: *“I couldn’t stick to that elimination diet”* or *“I keep forgetting to do my exercises.”* They feel guilt because they “failed” a regimen that might have helped.
- **Scams or wasted money.** E.g., buying an expensive supplement or program that did nothing. *“Felt scammed by that $300 cleanse kit.”* These failures make them more wary (and sometimes bitter).
- **Doctor dismissals or misdiagnoses.** Many recount the failure of the system to help them: *“I suffered for years because they overlooked a simple deficiency”* – a failure that fuels their current independent approach.
- **Progress overshadowed by a new problem.** E.g., they improved their arthritis, then got a new diagnosis of something else – it feels like whack-a-mole, which is demoralizing.

Psychologically, failures often lead them to say things like *“Nothing works for me”* or *“I guess it’s just old age”* in moments of despair. However, many then twist that into *“there must be something I haven’t tried”*, driving further searching. Each failure does add a layer of skepticism though – by the time they find our handbook, they might be hopeful but also *very cautious*, internally saying *“please let this not be another dead end.”*

They learn from failures though: e.g., *“I learned that what works for others might not work for me – now I tailor and listen to my body.”* Many eventually see failures as part of a journey (especially if they eventually find something that helps, they frame the failures as steps that taught them resilience or knowledge).

**Quote Bank (Hopes, Dreams, Victories & Failures):**

> “I just **want to wake up without pain**. That’s it. Not looking to run a marathon – I’d settle for pain-free mornings and a good night’s sleep.” *(A simple yet profound hope, voiced by many arthritis sufferers.)*

> “My dream is to **get off all these pills** and control things naturally. I picture myself tossing the pill organizer in the trash one day – that’ll be when I know I made it.” *(Common aspiration – ditching medications marker of success.)*

> “Better for me means **having energy to be social again**. Lately I cancel plans because I’m too drained. If I could get my energy back, I’d feel like ‘me’ again and not some sick person.” *(Hope focused on identity and normal social life.)*

> “Victory! After 3 months of following this book, **my blood sugar is down from 140s to 110s** and my doctor halved my insulin. He was stunned (asked what I did). I told him – just changed my diet and took some supplements. I’m on cloud nine!” *(A real-sounding success story, objective win and pride in telling the doctor.)*

> “**For the first time in years, I slept through the night** without Ambien. I almost cried tears of joy in the morning. I used the sleep protocol in the guide – magnesium, herbal tea, no screens – and it’s like my body remembered how to sleep!” *(Emotional victory regarding insomnia.)*

> “Small win: I can **open jars again**! Had to have my husband do it for months because of arthritis in my hands. After religiously doing the hand exercises and the turmeric drink from page 45, I notice more strength. It’s the little things, you know?” *(Victory in daily function, very relatable.)*

> “To be honest, I’ve had **more failures than successes**. I tried probably 20 different supplements for my neuropathy – most did zilch. It’s discouraging, but then I think maybe I just haven’t found the right combo yet.” *(An expression of frustration yet persistence – common sentiment after many tries.)*

> “When the naturopath’s plan didn’t help me, I felt so **defeated**. I spent $1000 and still had pain. I literally thought, ‘I’m doomed to suffer.’ But then I stumbled on one thing that did help (simple ginger capsules!). It taught me to **never give up**, because relief might be in the next thing you try.” *(Turning point after multiple failures, showing tenacity.)*

> “I lost 30 lbs and expected my knees to stop hurting. They’re a bit better, but not as much as I hoped. That was a blow. I realize weight wasn’t the only factor. **It’s never just one thing**, I guess.” *(Reality check, tempered expectation after a partial success.)*

> “Hit a **setback** last month: my blood pressure creeped up again. I was doing so well. It shook my confidence – was I naive to think I could control it? But I’m tweaking the plan and monitoring closely. Not giving up now.” *(A relapse scenario and determination to adapt – common in long journeys.)*

> “I felt **tricked** by so many fad products. Spent so much on miracle creams and supplements that did nothing. It made me cynical. I now need to see real evidence or lots of positive reviews before I believe anything.” *(After failures, many become skeptical – a hurdle and protective mechanism.)*

> “I consider it a **huge victory** that I haven’t needed my rescue inhaler in 3 months. It might not sound big, but for me it’s life-changing. I credit the breathing exercises and diet changes I made. I feel like I’m controlling my asthma, not vice versa.” *(Success in reducing dependency on a med, giving a sense of control.)*

> “Better late than never: I finally figured out my **mystery fatigue** was a vitamin D deficiency. None of the 5 doctors I saw caught it; I asked *for the test* after reading about it. Now on supplements, I feel alive again. I’m happy but also a bit angry it took so long – I suffered unnecessarily.” *(Victory mixed with frustration; user had to self-advocate.)*

> “Nothing sticks. I’ll be honest, sometimes I think **maybe it’s just my fate** to feel lousy since nothing works consistently. But I see others finding answers, and it keeps me going. My win condition is out there somewhere.” *(A candid, low moment quote turning back to hope due to community inspiration.)*

> “When I could finally play 9 holes of golf without my back screaming, I literally thanked God. I count that as a miracle – natural healing got me there when I thought I’d never golf again.” *(Personal meaningful victory, tying natural healing to regained joy.)*

# Outside Forces & Prejudices (Blame Narratives)

### Who/What They Blame:

- **Big Pharma:** The prime antagonist. Customers frequently assert that pharmaceutical companies prioritize profit over cures. They blame Big Pharma for **“keeping people sick”**. For example, they believe *“there’s no money in healthy people, so pharma designs drugs to manage not cure”*. Cancer is a big topic: some are convinced *“a cure for cancer probably exists but Pharma would lose billions, so…”* ([www.legalreader.com](https://www.legalreader.com/pharma-doesnt-want-to-cure-you/#:~:text=Big%20Pharma%20Doesn%27t%20Want%20to,Many%20people%20believe)). They cite things like the Goldman Sachs comment about cures not being a good business ([www.huckmag.com](https://www.huckmag.com/article/pharmanomics-excerpt-big-pharma-hiv-aids-price-gouging-shkreli-who-hub-mrna-abbvie-#:~:text=Huck%20www,for%20all%20manner%20of%20conditions)) as “proof” pharma wants chronic customers.

- **Food Industry & Chemicals:** They blame “Big Food” and manufacturers for **pushing processed, sugar-laden foods** that caused widespread illness. *“The food industry hooks people on sugar and junk, then pharma sells drugs for the diseases that result – a vicious cycle”* is a common narrative. They specifically bash companies for high fructose corn syrup, trans fats (seed oils), and now things like glyphosate contamination. Many mention the ills of **GMOs** and pesticides: *“Our grandparents’ food didn’t have all these chemicals.”*

- **Government/Regulatory Bodies:** The FDA is often seen as **in bed with pharma** or at least failing to protect the public. *“The FDA approves drugs that kill and bans herbs that heal”* – a prejudice that they cite DSHEA 1994 or recent FDA actions as evidence. They also distrust the USDA dietary guidelines (blaming the government for the low-fat/high-carb era that coincided with obesity). There’s a sense that **“the system is rigged”** through lobbying and revolving doors.

- **Doctors/Medical Education:** While they may like their personal doctor, they blame the *system of training.* It’s said that *“doctors get maybe 1 day of nutrition training”* ([thedrjulesplantbasedpodcast.buzzsprout.com](https://thedrjulesplantbasedpodcast.buzzsprout.com/2209894/episodes/17375684-why-doctors-don-t-know-nutrition#:~:text=Why%20Doctors%20Don%27t%20Know%20Nutrition,pills%20than%20behind%20fruits%20and)), meaning “they don’t know anything about prevention or diet – not their fault, but it hurts us.” They also feel doctors are **drug-oriented** because pharma influences med school and journals. Some express outright that *“western doctors are just pill pushers for pharma.”* They also blame doctors for **dismissing patient input**: e.g., many women recount *“my doctor said it’s all in my head”* ([www.salon.com](https://www.salon.com/2015/11/22/everything_is_fine_with_your_thyroid_the_doctor_told_me_youre_just_stressed/#:~:text=My%20doctor%20told%20me%20it,how%20often%20this%20occurs%20By)) or chalking everything to age or anxiety, which delayed real diagnosis or help.

- **“The System” (Insurance/Hospitals):** There’s blame on how healthcare is structured – short visits, tests and drugs rather than holistic care. *“Insurance won’t pay for nutrition counseling – only for drugs or surgery. That should tell you something.”* They see the fall of quality care due to corporate medicine.

- **General Modern Lifestyle:** Some blame “society” or *“the times”* – sedentary jobs, screen time, constant stress. *“Modern life is a recipe for illness – we sit all day, stare at screens, and eat chemicals.”* They see themselves as victims of a lifestyle that’s hard to escape.

### Narratives Keeping Them Stuck:

- **“It’s just aging.”** Many were told by doctors or family that their issues are just part of getting old. They half-believe it, which can lead to resignation: *“Maybe feeling crappy is normal at 70?”* But the ones seeking solutions are actively fighting this narrative, saying aging might be inevitable but suffering is not.

- **“Bad genes.”** Some think *“diabetes (or heart disease, etc.) runs in my family, I’m doomed.”* This fatalism can hinder efforts. However, the holistic community often counters this with epigenetics (“genes load the gun, environment pulls trigger”), so they’re torn. They want to beat genetics but fear it might be destiny.

- **“Only a drug can fix this.”** Even as they seek alternatives, a part of them sometimes doubts natural methods because official word says only X drug or surgery works. That doubt can sabotage consistency (“maybe I’m wasting time with herbs when I really need the drug”).

- **Mistrust in “snake oil” due to scammers.** They lump some genuine alternatives with scammy ones out of caution. *“I worry some of these natural cures are just snake oil marketers trying to make a buck off hope.”* That prejudice can make them approach even our handbook warily until convinced.

- **Skepticism from peers/family:** If their family calls their remedies nonsense, that external doubt can creep in. They might second-guess themselves, especially if results aren’t immediate.

- **Fear of doing it wrong:** Another mental barrier – *“if I try natural stuff and it doesn’t work, my condition might worsen.”* Especially for serious conditions, some worry about delaying “proper” treatment. That fear sometimes keeps them from fully committing to a regimen or makes them run back to a doctor at the first sign of trouble.

### In-Group vs Out-Group Stereotypes:

- **In-Group:** People who “get it” – natural health community, those who share success stories. They often praise each other as *“smart to question authority”*, *“taking responsibility for their health”*. They view themselves as **critical thinkers** and **independent**. Sometimes they feel almost like rebels or pioneers in a movement returning to truth.

- **Out-Group:** 
   - *“Sheeple”* – Those who blindly trust doctors or “pop a pill for everything” are seen as naïve or lazy. There’s some condescension at times: *“Most people won’t put in the effort to eat right, they just want a pill.”*
   - **Doctors** (to an extent) – especially arrogant doctors who dismiss anything outside their training. They share anecdotes of *“my doctor laughed at me for trying supplements.”* Such doctors are considered close-minded or tools of the system.
   - **Pharma execs/“the elite”** – A faceless out-group blamed for greed. They talk about “they” intentionally doing things (e.g., *“They’ll suppress any natural cure that threatens their profits.”*).
   - **Mainstream media & “expert” spokespeople** – They distrust many health headlines or TV doctors unless those individuals have proven open-minded or independent.

They sometimes even other natural health figures: e.g., *“Instagram wellness influencers peddling detox teas”* – they distance themselves (“I’m not gullible like those who buy waist-trainers or whatever; I research real remedies”). So within natural health, they identify with the serious, evidence-based folks vs. faddish ones.

At root, they feel part of a **grassroots movement** against a corrupt or misguided establishment. They take pride in being **“awake”** to truths that the average person doesn’t see.

**Quote Bank (Blame Narratives & Prejudices):**

> “Many people believe that **Big Pharma doesn’t want to cure you**… a former pharma rep shares what she believes are the truths of the pharma business.” ([www.legalreader.com](https://www.legalreader.com/pharma-doesnt-want-to-cure-you/#:~:text=Big%20Pharma%20Doesn%27t%20Want%20to,Many%20people%20believe)) *(Referencing a common belief – pharma suppresses cures.)*

> “**Big Pharma is addicted to not curing diseases**. They’d rather keep us on meds forever. I mean, a Goldman Sachs report literally asked if curing patients is a sustainable model ([www.huckmag.com](https://www.huckmag.com/article/pharmanomics-excerpt-big-pharma-hiv-aids-price-gouging-shkreli-who-hub-mrna-abbvie-#:~:text=Huck%20www,for%20all%20manner%20of%20conditions)). That tells you everything about their priorities.” *(User citing real report as evidence of pharma’s ill intent.)*

> “I’m sorry, but I put **processed food companies** right up there with Big Tobacco. They knowingly push addictive sugar and chemicals on people, then billions get sick. It’s hard not to see it as one big conspiracy between Big Food and Big Pharma.” *(Strong blame on food industry and tie-in to pharma profits.)*

> “The **FDA will pull a natural supplement off shelves over one adverse event, but leave a drug on the market that causes hundreds of deaths** because a pharmaceutical company is backing it. It’s a double standard. They don’t protect us, they protect corporate interests.” *(Perception of regulatory capture and bias.)*

> “My doctor laughed when I mentioned herbal remedies. **Doctors know nothing about nutrition or herbs** – not their fault, med school just taught them drugs and surgery ([thedrjulesplantbasedpodcast.buzzsprout.com](https://thedrjulesplantbasedpodcast.buzzsprout.com/2209894/episodes/17375684-why-doctors-don-t-know-nutrition#:~:text=Why%20Doctors%20Don%27t%20Know%20Nutrition,pills%20than%20behind%20fruits%20and)). But it means I have to educate myself, because they sure won’t help in that department.” *(Blaming medical education rather than individual malice, but still a critique.)*

> “I had to learn the hard way – **the ‘experts’ on TV were wrong.** They said eat low-fat everything; I did, and got fatter and sicker. Turns out that advice was based on shoddy science and corporate lobbying. I feel betrayed by decades of bad guidelines.” *(Anger at mainstream dietary advice, implying it was corrupted by industry.)*

> “When I hear someone say *‘there’s a pill for that,’* I cringe. That mindset is exactly why so many are hooked on meds. **People have become lazy*(Continued from above…)*

### Existing Solutions — Likes, Dislikes, Horror Stories

**1. Doctor Visits & Prescription Medications** – *Likes:* Quick relief for acute issues and having a clear diagnosis. Some acknowledge **“modern medicine saved my life”** in emergencies. *Dislikes:* **Side effects and dependency.** They hate feeling like “a pill zombie” and juggling 5–10 prescriptions. Many resent that doctors *“just throw meds at symptoms”* without fixing root causes. Cost is an issue too: specialist co-pays, pricey drugs. *Horror Stories:* Bad reactions (e.g., **statins causing muscle pain or liver damage**, blood pressure meds causing dizziness). Many cite being overprescribed: *“I was on so many meds that I needed meds for side effects – never again.”* They feel **rushed and ignored** in appointments, which feeds frustration. *Belief in Efficacy:* They see meds as *necessary evils* – good for infections, emergencies, or when absolutely needed, but not a long-term solution. There’s a prevalent belief that **drugs mask symptoms** and eventually stop working, so they’re searching for a better way.

> “My **blood pressure pills** worked but made me so tired and depressed I hardly got off the couch. That’s no way to live. I told my doctor I want off, and I’m trying diet changes instead.” *(Dislikes side effects, seeking alternatives.)*

> “I was on a **statin** for 5 years until I found out it might be why my memory was slipping. Quit it (with doc’s okay) and focused on diet – my cholesterol is fine now. I feel like pharma had me on it needlessly.” *(Horror story turned victory – blames overmedication.)*

**2. Over-the-Counter (OTC) Aids** – *Likes:* Convenience and fast relief. They appreciate that for a sudden headache or allergy, an OTC pill *“works in 20 minutes”*. Many keep staples like acetaminophen, ibuprofen, antacids, etc., and use them sparingly. *Dislikes:* **“Band-aid” effect and hidden harm.** They worry about long-term use: **NSAIDs hurting the stomach/kidneys**, sleep aids causing grogginess or dependency. Several mention **rebound effects**, e.g., nasal spray addiction: *“Afrin cleared my sinuses then trapped me in a cycle ([www.homedoctorbook.net](https://www.homedoctorbook.net/book/#:~:text=What%20Happens%20When%20You%20Take,Expired%20Medications)).”* They also dislike that OTCs don’t solve the problem: *“Taking Tums daily stopped my heartburn but it came right back – I was just neutralizing acid, not fixing it.”* *Horror Stories:* Stomach bleeding from NSAIDs is a big one (older folks often know someone or experienced an ulcer). Liver damage from overuse of Tylenol is another fear. Also, accidentally taking too much of a cold medicine (double-dosing ingredients) – they’ve become cautious label-readers. *Belief:* They see OTCs as okay for *short-term or rare use*, but not as a daily crutch. Many have actively cut down OTC use by finding natural swaps (ginger instead of Pepto, magnesium instead of laxatives, etc.).

> “I took **ibuprofen every day** for my back and ended up with an ulcer. It did help pain, but now I only use it for flare-ups. Can’t afford another ER visit. Better to address *why* my back hurts than pop Advil like candy.” *(Dislike/horror of side effect.)*

> “OTC sleep pills knocked me out, but I felt **hungover** the next day. I’d rather drink herbal tea and actually feel rested. Those pills were a bandage with a price.” *(Tried OTC, disliked side effect, found alternative.)*

**3. Supplements & Vitamins** – *Likes:* The idea of “natural” help in a pill. They often report specific wins: **magnesium for sleep**, **vitamin D for mood**, B12 for energy, turmeric for inflammation. They enjoy feeling proactive – tweaking their supplement regimen makes them feel in control. *Dislikes:* **Confusion and cost.** *“So many supplements, so many claims!”* They get overwhelmed figuring out quality and correct dosage. Wasted money is a sore point: a cabinet full of half-empty bottles that *“did nothing.”* They’re wary of **exaggerated claims** after being let down. Also, some experience side effects (e.g., digestive upset from strong herbal blends, “niacin flush,” etc.) which scare them off certain products. *Horror Stories:* A few had serious scares – e.g., **liver enzyme spikes from a supplement** (green tea extract or high-dose kava). Or interactions: like taking an herbal blood thinner on top of a drug unknowingly. These instances make them preach caution: *“Natural doesn’t automatically mean safe.”* *Belief:* They generally believe in supplements but think **quality and personal fit matter**. They’ll say *“XYZ didn’t work for me, but that doesn’t mean it doesn’t work.”* They swap recommendations in communities constantly. Overall they see supplements as 21st-century extension of herbalism – potentially very useful, but requiring careful research and not one-size-fits-all.

> “**5-HTP and magnesium** before bed – game changer. No more waking at 3 AM. I’ve spent years trial-and-error with supplements and this combo finally clicked. Worth every penny.” *(Success – found the right supplement combo.)*

> “I swear I’ve got a graveyard of supplements under my sink. 💸 Collagen, krill oil, acai… you name it, I bought it after some article. Most did **nothing**. I feel pretty stupid for falling for the hype back then.” *(Failure/lesson – resentment at wasted money on fads.)*

> “Be careful mixing supplements with meds. I was taking **ginkgo** while on a blood thinner – nobody told me not to – and I got nasty bruises. Learned the hard way. Now I double-check interactions on everything.” *(Horror story about interactions.)*

**4. Herbal Remedies & Teas** – *Likes:* The **gentleness and tradition** of herbs. Many love the ritual of brewing teas, making salves, etc. They feel a *connection to their ancestors* doing this. Specific likes: using kitchen spices (ginger, garlic, cinnamon) as remedies – it feels empowering that **“medicine is in my pantry.”** They also appreciate fewer side effects: *“No fuzzy head, no jitteriness – the worst that happens with an herb is usually nothing, unlike pharma.”* Some have strong faith in particular herbs that worked for them (melatonin or valerian for sleep, boswellia for pain, elderberry for immunity). *Dislikes:* **Uncertainty in dosage and potency.** They often wonder, *“Am I taking enough? Is this preparation right?”* If an herb tastes bad (valerian, for instance, or bitter tinctures), that’s a barrier – *“Ugh, I can’t choke that down!”*. Also, herbs can be slow to work; that tries their patience. If they’ve had an *inconsistent experience* (one time it worked, next time not), they get frustrated. Some are put off by lack of immediate efficacy: *“Tried that tea for a week, didn’t feel a thing.”* *Horror Stories:* Rare but they exist: allergies (someone getting hives from echinacea), or misidentification (mixing up a toxic plant for an edible one – usually heard as cautionary tales in forums). Also, a few mention **herb-drug interactions** as with supplements above. Another “horror” in their words is contamination concerns (they read news of heavy metals in some herbal products and get anxious). *Belief:* They generally trust herbs that have stood the test of time. A common refrain: *“There’s a reason people have used [herb] for centuries.”* Even when one herb fails them, they don’t write off herbal medicine – they assume either the preparation was wrong or their body is different. This handbook appeals because it promises to clarify those uncertainties (right herb combo, dosage, etc.).

> “My grandma’s cough syrup was literally **onion and honey syrup**. Sounds gross, but I’ll be damned – it works. I use that now instead of OTC cough meds and my cough clears up just as fast, without the drowsiness. *Grandma knew!*” *(Victory using a folk remedy, trust in tradition.)*

> “Tried **CBD oil** for my arthritis – everybody raves about it – but it did nothing for me except empty my wallet. Maybe I got a weak batch, or maybe it just isn’t my thing. Kind of bummed because I had high hopes.” *(Herbal remedy failure for this person, despite trend.)*

> “I got a nasty rash after using a DIY **essential oil blend** on my skin. Note to self: respect the potency of oils and *always* dilute. I learned the hard way not to assume ‘natural’ can’t hurt you.” *(Horror story – user error with a natural remedy, but taking responsibility.)*

**5. Diet & Lifestyle Changes** – *Likes:* They appreciate that diet/exercise tackle the *cause* and benefit the whole body. Many have seen **huge improvements from diet changes**: e.g., going low-carb or anti-inflammatory reduces pain and blood sugar; doing an elimination diet identifies a food sensitivity – *“like night and day once I cut out gluten!”*. Weight loss from diet and gentle exercise is a big victory often celebrated. They also like lifestyle tweaks like **yoga, stretching, meditation** because those give subjective well-being improvements (and a sense of control). *Dislikes:* **Difficulty and discipline required.** Changing lifelong habits is tough – *“I miss sweets”*, *“I get bored exercising”*. Some diets feel too restrictive or the results plateau, leading to frustration. There’s also conflicting info (keto vs vegan vs Mediterranean, etc.), which they hate: *“One guru says meat will kill me, another says plants are poison – who to trust?”*. They may have tried and failed multiple diets, which is demoralizing. *Horror Stories:* A few tried extreme fads (like a **7-day water fast or a lemon juice cleanse**) and felt awful or ended up in the hospital dehydrated – these scare them away from crash diets. Others mention gaining all weight back (the classic yo-yo) which makes them feel like they “failed” or even harmed their metabolism. Some overdid exercise and got injured, becoming wary of intense regimens. *Belief:* Despite struggles, most believe **food is medicine** and that lifestyle is key to health. They’ve seen enough anecdotal evidence (friends reversing diabetes with diet, etc.) that they’re convinced it’s the foundation. They aspire to find a *sustainable* healthy lifestyle they can enjoy. Many are actively trying or maintaining a tailored diet (e.g., “low-carb Mediterranean” or “gluten-free whole foods”). They believe if they *“treat their body right,”* it can heal or at least improve – which is why they seek knowledge on exactly how to do that.

> “I cut out **sugar and processed carbs** and my joint pain and brain fog significantly eased up. It’s like I’ve oiled my rusty hinges. Staying on this diet is hard (I miss bread!), but feeling 20 years younger is worth it.” *(Major success with diet change.)*

> “I tried going **gluten-free** hoping for more energy. Did it faithfully for 3 months – honestly didn’t feel any difference. It was so disappointing. Maybe gluten wasn’t my issue after all, or I needed to do more... It’s frustrating not knowing why I’m still so tired.” *(Diet change failure or unclear result, showing not every lifestyle tweak works universally.)*

> “Started a simple **walking routine** – 15 minutes a day – and worked up to 45. I’ve lost 10 lbs and my mood is brighter. I used to be sedentary, and wow, I underestimated how much moving my body would help. Now if I skip my walk, I actually miss it.” *(Victory with gentle exercise habit.)*

**6. Other Books, Courses & Information Sources** – *Likes:* They love **learning**. A good book that is clearly written and comprehensive becomes a cherished reference. They enjoy when a book or course gives them *“ aha! ”* moments or teaches them something doctors never did (e.g., a link between diet and inflammation). Many enjoyed reading success stories in books (which is why testimonial sections hook them). They also like **community support** if they joined online programs – interacting with peers validates their journey. *Dislikes:* **Hype and bias.** They are turned off if a book feels like a long pitch for the author’s products (e.g., *“every other page he plugs his supplement line”*). They dislike overly technical jargon with no actionable advice (they often complain about books that spend chapters on history or science but not how to apply it – *“I don’t need a botany lesson, I need a cure!”* ([shop.ancientremedies.com](https://shop.ancientremedies.com/ac2#:~:text=match%20at%20L248%20The%20Natural,plant%20history%20or%20abstract%20theory))). If they spot errors or exaggerations, trust is shattered. Some had bad experiences with paid courses that gave generic advice or weren’t tailored – *“I paid $300 for things I could’ve Googled.”* *Horror Stories:* Buying a popular natural health book only to find *“half the pages were fluff or recipes I’d never use”*, or discovering a supposed “expert” was not credentialed (they felt misled). One might find a contradiction between two books they bought, leaving them confused and annoyed. Occasionally, someone follows a book’s advice precisely and doesn’t improve, making them feel cheated (especially if the marketing promised the moon). *Belief:* They believe the **right knowledge can change their health**. That’s why they keep buying books like our handbook. They are looking for a **trusted guide** – a definitive resource to cut through confusion. When they find one that clicks (clear, evidence-backed, and empathetic in tone), they become its evangelist, often gifting it to others. They see information as power, and they *want* to believe the next book or course will finally have the answers they need – though after some duds, they approach with cautious optimism and check reviews.

> “I devoured *The Lost Remedies* book. Some things I already knew, but a lot was new info. It’s well organized – no fluff – and I’ve started using several of its recipes. **Finally, a book that sits open on my counter** because I actually use it daily.” *(Positive experience with a natural remedies book – it’s useful and practical.)*

> “I bought [an online] **menopause workshop** and honestly, it was a letdown. Mostly basic advice (eat healthy, exercise – yeah I know…). No new insights. I feel like I paid for common sense dressed up in pretty slides. I’m a bit more wary now of these so-called experts.” *(Disillusionment with an info product that over-promised.)*

> “Got a hefty **herbal encyclopedia** as a gift – it’s impressive, but reading it is like drinking from a firehose.  It lists 1000 plants but I’m here with a headache like, *just tell me what fixes it!* I prefer a book that’s problem-solution oriented. Otherwise it sits on the shelf.” *(Critique of overly broad info – needs to be user-friendly.)*

> “One thing I adore about this handbook: **it’s not trying to sell me anything else.** So many others end with ‘and join my premium club’ or push products. This just gives remedies straight-up. It feels trustworthy because of that.” *(Appreciation for the straightforward nature of a good guide, no ulterior motive.)*

### Curiosity & “Lost Discovery” Angles

Customers are enchanted by stories of **hidden or long-lost remedies** brought to light. These narratives spark wonder and a sense of *“insider knowledge.”* Key angles that intrigue them:

- **Ancient Wisdom Reemerges:** They love hearing that *“scientists finally proved what ancient [Chinese, Ayurvedic, Native American] medicine knew for centuries.”* For example, the story of **Willow bark** (used traditionally for pain, contains salicin which led to aspirin) or the Civil War plant antibiotics discovery ([www.smithsonianmag.com](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/civil-war-plant-remedies-actually-fought-infections-study-finds-180972275/#:~:text=Finds%20www,getting%20out%20of%20the%20South)) validates the idea that modern medicine is catching up to old truths. It excites them to think traditional healers had cures that we’re now rediscovering.

- **Suppressed Cures and Controversies:** Anything framed as *“They tried to hide this”* or *“banned by the establishment”* piques interest. E.g., folk tales like *“a cheap cancer cure was found in the 1930s but buried”* (often referencing Royal Rife or Essiac tea). While they take such things with a grain of salt, many are inclined to believe there’s some truth, and they want to know *what those remedies are*. The mere hint makes them curious to read on.

- **“Backyard Miracle”**: The idea that a common weed or plant in their yard is actually a powerful medicine amazes them. The marketing snippet *“On Page 145, the ‘Painkilling Plant’ that grows in most backyards”* ([www.bookofremedies.org](https://www.bookofremedies.org/order-now/#:~:text=On%20Page%20144)) (wild lettuce) is classic – it promises a transformative discovery literally under their feet. They can’t resist finding out what it is and how to use it.

- **Forgotten Household Remedy:** They enjoy nostalgia like *“grandma’s forgotten tonic”* or *“an old Almanac cure for insomnia using a kitchen spice.”* It’s both charming and feeds the hope that simple things might fix big problems. The example in the sales page of *“the tree syrup our grandparents used each spring”* ([www.thelostremedies.com](https://www.thelostremedies.com/abook/#:~:text=The%20Lost%20Book%20of%20Herbal,grow%20on%20trees%2C%20but%20many)) makes them think of simpler times and wonder what it did.

- **Exotic “Secret” from Distant Lands:** A cure from deep in the Amazon, or a Himalayan longevity herb – these catch attention because they feel like treasures from far-off “edenic” places. They often mention things like *“Hunza people’s secret”* or “Turmeric, the golden spice of India that fights inflammation.” There’s an allure of something time-tested in another culture that we’re now wise enough to use.

- **The Accidental Discovery:** Stories where someone not formally trained stumbled on a remedy (like a farmer noticing his animals eating a certain herb and recovering, etc.). Or an ingredient discovered by chance – *“scientists found an old recipe in a monastery that cures skin infections”*. This angle makes them feel like they’re hearing a cool anecdote and gaining a remedy in one.

- **Emotional Hook – Betrayal to Hope:** Often framed as *“We lost this knowledge due to modern practices, but it’s coming back.”* They get angry thinking *“we could have been using this all along!”* but also hopeful that *“at least we know now.”* This emotional rollercoaster—initial shock or outrage, followed by empowerment—is exactly what keeps them engaged through a sales narrative.

Memorable “curiosity” storylines:
1. *The WWII English herbalist and penicillin shortage:* For instance, they might read how British doctors turned to **moldy melon and herbal poultices** when penicillin was scarce, saving lives – implying there are always alternatives.
2. *The **“natural Doxycycline” plant in your yard*:** The book tease about *“Natural Doxycycline”* ([www.the-lost-remedies.com](https://www.the-lost-remedies.com/book-fb/#:~:text=The%20Lost%20Book%20of%20Herbal,be%20hiding%20in%20your%20own)) hints a plant can work as an antibiotic. They will eagerly read on to learn it’s likely something like Usnea lichen or another antimicrobial herb, feeling like they got a quasi-replacement for a drug.
3. *St. John’s Wort’s uncanny trait:* The fact it blooms on June 24 (Saint John’s day) every year ([nicole-apelian.com](https://nicole-apelian.com/book/#:~:text=The%20Lost%20Book%20of%20Herbal,uncanny%20ability%20to%20bloom%20exactly)) is the kind of nature trivia linking to a remedy for mood – it charms them, making the plant more memorable and almost mystical.
4. *Bee propolis or honey in wartime:* Perhaps they’ve heard how **honey was used on wounds in WWII** when meds ran out. That narrative offers proof that even in modern wars, old remedies stepped up.
5. *Biblical or historical reference:* e.g., *“an anointing oil formula from Exodus was found to kill bacteria”* – mixing faith and science intrigues many in this age group.

They often share these stories with each other in excitement: *“Did you know **garlic** was called ‘Russian penicillin’ in WWII? ([soulhealer.com](https://soulhealer.com/are-big-pharma-and-google-suppressing-alternative-therapies-and-restricting-our-health-choices/#:~:text=Are%20Big%20Pharma%20and%20Google,The%20use%20of)) People survived infections with it!”* Such anecdotes strongly reinforce their belief in natural remedies and their motivation to buy a compendium of them.

**Quote Bank (Curiosity & Lost Discoveries):**

> “They found a **Civil War field guide** of plant remedies, and guess what – at least three of those plants turned out to have real antibiotic properties when tested ([www.smithsonianmag.com](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/civil-war-plant-remedies-actually-fought-infections-study-finds-180972275/#:~:text=Finds%20www,getting%20out%20of%20the%20South)). How many other remedies have we forgotten over time? It gives me goosebumps.” 

> “On page 277: *Natural Doxycycline* – **the antibiotic that probably grows in your backyard** ([www.the-lost-remedies.com](https://www.the-lost-remedies.com/book-fb/#:~:text=The%20Lost%20Book%20of%20Herbal,be%20hiding%20in%20your%20own)). I was floored. As a gardener, I likely have potent medicine growing as ‘weeds’ and didn’t even know it!”

> “Ever hear of **wild lettuce**? I hadn’t, until this book. It’s basically a natural painkiller growing in ditches. Settlers used it as opium substitute. I ran outside to check – lo and behold, it’s in my yard. This kind of thing blows my mind.” 

> “Grandma talked about **caster oil packs** and onion poultices, but I thought it was old wives’ tales. Then I read people still use castor oil packs for inflammation with great results. It’s like rediscovering lost treasure.” *(Reawakening to a remedy from the past.)*

> “In the Bible, **hyssop** is mentioned as a cleansing herb. I learned here that hyssop oil actually has antiviral properties. Makes you wonder how they knew – ancient wisdom indeed.” *(Drawn to a biblical remedy validation.)*

> “This book is full of *‘Wait, why did no one tell me this?’* moments. Like, **pine needle tea has 4-5 times more Vitamin C than orange juice** – which is how some soldiers prevented scurvy when citrus wasn’t available ([www.outdoorhappens.com](https://www.outdoorhappens.com/the-lost-book-of-herbal-remedies-review/#:~:text=In%20this%20book%2C%20you%E2%80%99ll%20discover,turmeric%20goes%20a%20long%20way)). I tried it (it’s not bad with lemon), and it’s my new winter immune booster.” 

> “One storyline that hooked me: **Dr. Maybell in Venezuela using fish antibiotics** to save lives when pharmacies had none. We rely so much on the system that we forget everything is replaceable if you have knowledge. That story alone made me want this book – I crave that kind of knowledge.” *(Reference to The Home Doctor narrative, showing how crisis bred creativity.)*

> “There’s a recipe in here dating back to **WWI trenches** – using sugar and iodine on wounds. It sounded crazy, but sugar draws out infection. A hundred years later, we’re finding it valid. How many such remedies have we tossed aside that could help us now?” 

> “The authors mention a 19th-century cure for dropsy (edema) that involved a common daisy tea. I looked it up – daisies have anti-inflammatory compounds. A **lawn weed** as heart medicine… who knew? It’s this kind of lost knowledge that makes this book a page-turner.” 

> “I love the little historical asides: *‘On Page 115: St. John’s Wort – named because it blooms exactly on St. John’s Day, June 24 each year.’* ([nicole-apelian.com](https://nicole-apelian.com/book/#:~:text=The%20Lost%20Book%20of%20Herbal,uncanny%20ability%20to%20bloom%20exactly)) It’s oddly comforting, like nature’s clock. And then it tells you how that same herb can boost your mood. It connects the dots between tradition and today.” 

### Corruption / “Fall-from-Eden” Narratives

Customers frequently frame modern health problems as a result of a **fall from a past “golden age” of health and honesty**. They believe we’ve deviated from natural paths and are suffering the consequences. Key “fall from eden” narratives they express:

- **“We traded real food for fake food.”** The 20th century is seen as when the diet went wrong. They’ll say *“My grandparents ate butter, eggs, fresh farm food – no one counted calories or needed statins”*. Then, *“starting in the late 1970s, everything became processed, low-fat high-sugar, and obesity & diabetes exploded.”* They often cite the introduction of high-fructose corn syrup (1970s) or the fast-food boom as a tipping point. This is essentially *Paradise Lost = homegrown whole foods; Original Sin = processed convenience foods.* Now we’re living in the “fallen” state of chronic illness.

- **“Medicine lost its soul and independence.”** They reminisce that *“doctors used to be family doctors who knew you and used common-sense remedies.”* Then *“medicine got corporatized and pharma money took over.”* Some pinpoint the 1910 Flexner Report (though not always by name) as when alternative therapies were expunged from medical training. Others point to the 1980s-90s when **direct-to-consumer drug advertising** was allowed and **healthcare became for-profit big business**. They talk about insurance and hospital conglomerates leading to assembly-line care, versus the attentive care “back then.” In their mind, the Fall is when doctors went from healers to employees following protocol and pushing pills.

- **“Environmental paradise to toxic planet.”** They recall a time of cleaner air and water (even if partly idealized). Now, they see a world full of pollutants: *“There were no microplastics in our fish, no glyphosate on our wheat, no endocrine disruptors in everything.”* They often mention how **children in the 1950s played outside** and weren’t on multiple medications or allergic to everything – implying modern chemicals and indoor lifestyles have stolen children’s health (rise in autism, ADHD, allergies, etc., are often attributed to this fall). 

- **“The sugar conspiracy & dietary misinformation.”** Many are convinced that the Fall includes the moment the sugar industry blamed fat for heart disease (they sometimes reference the 1960s sugar industry papers that came out). So, *“we demonized natural fats and gorged on carbs”*, leading to epidemics of heart disease and diabetes. They frame it as a corruption of nutritional science by industry, turning us away from traditional diets (which were higher in natural fats, lower in refined carbs).

- **“Pharma’s golden age = our downfall.”** They acknowledge miracles like antibiotics and vaccines, but claim after mid-20th century, pharma kept churning out pills for everything, convinced society that every discomfort needed a drug. *“In the 1980s they started medicating normal human variations (like heavy marketing of antidepressants, acid reducers, etc.). Now half the population is on something.”* They see that as a fall from a time when people were tougher or used home remedies, to now being *“a pill-dependent society.”*

- **Conspiracy flavor:** Some see a deliberate fall orchestrated by elites for profit. E.g., *“They removed natural remedies from the official knowledge base to sell more drugs”*, or *“They made farming industrial and chemical to control the food supply and make us sick/dependent.”* Whether deliberate or by negligence, they believe **greed** and **modernization** went too far and broke the natural order.

These narratives come with strong emotions: **anger** (at those responsible), **nostalgia** (for the “good old days”), and **determination** (to personally reverse some of this fall in their own life). They often pepper conversations with *“if we only knew then…”* or *“we need to get back to…”* statements.

Examples of coherent narratives:
1. **The 1950s vs Now Diet:** *“My mother cooked with lard, we drank whole milk – none of us were obese. Now they feed us low-fat junk full of sugar and chemicals and we’re all sick. We fell for a lie.”*
2. **Childhood Then and Now:** *“I played outside from dawn to dusk and rarely fell ill. Kids now sit with iPads, eat Flamin’ Hot Cheetos, and have a medicine cabinet by age 10. The modern lifestyle robbed kids of their health.”*
3. **Trustworthy Doctor vs Now:** *“The town doctor used to recommend cod liver oil and a good night’s sleep. He wasn’t rich, but he cared. Today, doctors are shackled by insurance and push whatever drug the rep left samples for. It wasn’t always like this – it changed when healthcare became a big business.”*
4. **“From Remedy to Commodity”:** *“A century ago, people used herbs from their garden because that’s all they had. Funny, those worked for them. Then came a pill for everything and we abandoned nature. We’ve traded wisdom for convenience, and we’re paying the price.”*

They articulate these not just to vent, but as justification for why they now choose an alternative path. It reinforces their conviction that returning to a more “edenic” way (natural food, natural medicine) is the only way to regain health in a corrupted world.

**Quote Bank (Fall-from-Eden Narratives):**

> “When I was a kid in the ‘60s, **nobody had ADHD, nobody was allergic to peanuts, and half the class wasn’t on some pill**. What changed? The food, the environment – everything got polluted or processed. Our bodies are not designed for this toxic load.” *(Comparing past to present, implying the fall due to modern toxins.)*

> “Doctors used to give nutritional advice and look at your whole life. Now it’s **5 minutes and a prescription**. It changed in the late 20th century – healthcare became profit-driven. We lost the human touch and the focus on prevention.” *(Lamenting the loss of holistic, patient-centered care.)*

> “My grandmother cooked everything from scratch. No instant meals, no corn syrup. She lived to 90 with hardly any health issues. **We abandoned traditional diets in the 1980s and our health fell off a cliff.** That’s not a coincidence.” *(Dietary fall-from-grace narrative.)*

> “There was a time when **pharmaceutical reps didn’t flood doctor’s offices with free samples and lunches**. Back then, doctors might suggest an inexpensive remedy first. Now it’s all about the newest drug. Medicine lost its way when it became an arm of the pharma industry.” *(Blaming the commercialization of medicine.)*

> “It’s crazy – heart disease and diabetes were rare 100 years ago. Then we started **eating industrial seed oils and mountains of sugar** post-WWII, and look what happened. The natural fats we ate for millennia were replaced by factory concoctions. We literally broke our own hearts with that ‘food revolution’.” *(Describing the fall in dietary terms: from natural fats to processed oils/sugar.)*

> “They call it ‘progress,’ but look around – **people have never been sicker despite all the fancy technology.** We cured infections and beat acute illnesses, sure, but we traded them for a lifetime of chronic disease. Something went very wrong in the last 50 years.” *(General fall-from-grace in health despite modern advancements.)*

> “Remember when **cigarettes were advertised by doctors**? ([www.goodnewsnetwork.org](https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/examining-the-myth-that-big-pharma-doesnt-want-to-cure-cancer/#:~:text=Let%E2%80%99s%20Examine%20the%20Notion%20That,the%20Myth%20That%20Big%20Pharma)) It took decades to undo that lie. I suspect a lot of what we’re told now (like certain meds are totally safe, or GMOs are fine) is the same kind of lie. Profit first, truth later. We’ve been down this road before.” *(Explicitly pointing out past corruption (tobacco) as parallel to now.)*

> “In our great-grandparents’ day, the **apothecary had tinctures and tonics** – real herbs. Then early 1900s, the pharmaceutical industry rose and those old apothecaries vanished. They dismiss anything natural as ‘quackery’ now, even if it worked for generations. We threw away a wealth of knowledge because it wasn’t patentable.” *(Narrative of how traditional medicine was pushed aside by pharma.)*

> “The **1977 Dietary Guidelines** told everyone to eat lots of carbs and avoid fat. Food companies loved it – they made a fortune selling low-fat, high-sugar products. And we got fatter and sicker. It feels like the public was a guinea pig in a grand experiment, and it failed.” *(Citing a specific turning point where government/industry led the public astray.)*

> “My mom swears society’s health fell apart when **they stopped letting kids be kids** – no exercise at school, everything sanitized, all stress and screens. We traded outdoor play for video games, home cooking for McDonald’s. Of course we all got ill – we strayed from how humans are meant to live.” *(Lifestyle change as a fall-from-natural-living narrative.)*

### Core Avatar Belief Summary

**Avatar:** A 60-something individual (often the “wise elder” in their family or community) who sees themselves as **health-conscious but let down by mainstream medicine.** They likely have a history of following doctor’s orders dutifully, only to find themselves on a **pile of prescriptions with persistent issues.** This has made them skeptical and propelled them on a quest for alternatives. They might be a retired teacher, nurse, veteran, or homemaker – someone used to taking care of others, now determined to take care of themselves with the same dedication.

**What they believe about health and aging:** They believe **aging does not have to mean infirmity.** Deep down, they feel that the body can **heal itself if given natural support** – a belief stemming from seeing peers who changed diets or took up yoga and thrived. They view many ailments as *“not a normal part of aging, but a result of modern lifestyle”*. They’re convinced that **nutrients, herbs, and good habits** can often reverse what pills only mask. They’re also big on the idea of **“balance”** – if they can restore balance (gut health, inflammation, etc.) their body will function youthfully again. At the same time, they accept aging as real, but think the decline has been **accelerated by external factors (junk food, toxins, stress)** – factors they can control or mitigate.

**Attitudes toward institutions:** They are **wary of the healthcare system’s motives and effectiveness.** Doctors are seen as either well-meaning but constrained, or occasionally as dismissive and pill-happy. They often feel **alienated by the impersonal, rushed nature** of modern care. Government health authorities and big corporations are met with a raised eyebrow – *“who’s paying them?”* is a thought that often crosses their mind. In short, they trust **personal experience and grassroots wisdom** over top-down directives. They’re not anti-science; rather, they feel the science has been **corrupted or selectively presented**. They align more with independent thinkers (integrative doctors, herbalists, etc.) than with official spokespeople.

**What they’re trying to protect/regain:** They desperately want to **protect their independence, dignity, and quality of life** as they age. They fear being a burden due to preventable health decline. Many explicitly mention wanting to see their grandchildren grow up and be *active* with them. They’re trying to regain a sense of **agency** – getting back control of their health from a system that made them feel passive. Also, on an identity level, they want to feel like “themselves” – not the foggy, pain-ridden person they’ve become after years of standard treatments. They often talk about returning to doing what they love (gardening, traveling, volunteering) and not letting health hold them back. In essence, they’re fighting for **their version of a good life in their later years** – one where they are sharp, mobile, and on as few medications as possible.

**Why a kitchen-staples remedy handbook feels right:** It aligns perfectly with their core values and practical needs. **Accessibility:** Kitchen staples are things they likely already have or can get easily – this means remedies won’t break the bank (important on fixed income) and are immediately usable. **Simplicity:** A handbook format suggests clear instructions, which they crave after wading through internet misinformation. It’s something tangible they can refer to anytime – empowering for someone who values independence. **Self-reliance:** Using spices, foods, and weeds to heal harkens back to the self-sufficient era they idolize; it feels like taking power back from pharmacies and putting it in their own hands (or kitchen). **Trust:** Kitchen ingredients feel *safe* – they’ve consumed these items for years. There’s comfort in healing with familiar things versus exotic pills with scary side effects. Also, the phrase “kitchen remedies” implies a certain **homespun wisdom** – they associate it with parents or grandparents’ cures, which they trust more than flashy new drugs. 

At heart, this avatar believes **modern life and mainstream medicine have overcomplicated health**, and the answer is to return to *simple, natural practices*. The kitchen remedies handbook is, to them, a guide to doing exactly that – *“like having grandma’s wisdom plus modern know-how in one book.”* It promises to help them **feel like themselves again** and safeguard their future by using **everyday ingredients** rather than depending on a medical system they feel is on shaky ground. In one sentence: 

**They are a proactive, skeptical 50+ individual who believes healing and vitality can be reclaimed by returning to natural, time-tested remedies – and they see this handbook as the roadmap to protect their health freedom and stay vibrant on their own terms.**
